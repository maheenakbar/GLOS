These estimates were based on current distribution patterns and environmental conditions.  Phragmites presence or absence was defined based on a distribution map produced by cooperative research between the GLSC and Michigan Technical Research Institute.  Environmental variables were processed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and came from existing publicly available sources.  Variables include descriptors of soils, nutrients, topography, ecoregion, anthropogenic disturbance, and climate.  Environmental conditions and Phragmites presence/absence were sampled in a GIS at points established at systematic 100-m intervals across the study area.Habitat suitability was estimated for Phragmites at each systematic sample location.  A correlative ecological niche model (boosted regression trees) was used to produce a continuous probabilistic index that ranged between zero and one.  This index was rescaled in to six categories of relative habitat suitability by specifying a threshold for suitable/unsuitable conditions where the proportion of presence locations classified as suitable equated to the proportion of absence locations classified as unsuitable.  After applying this threshold, the data ranges classified as suitable/unsuitable were split at equal increments to result in six categories of relative suitability.","Great Lakes coastal wetlands, Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), forecasting invasive Phragmites corridors, species distribution modeling, boosted regression trees, vulnerability assessment",,,"######javascript:addWMSLayer([[\""0\"",\""http://cida.usgs.gov/arcgis/services/GLRI68_Phragmites/MapServer/WMSServer\"", \""0\"",\""270\""]])###/metadata/srv/eng/google.kml?uuid=e1ddf058-73a0-4978-b11d-8a889063441f&layers=0",2014-08-11T16:00:42,e433d82a-e5bc-4eb0-a853-76cbe0913250,/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?id=270&fname=habitat_suitability_s.png&access=public###/metadata/srv/eng/graphover.show?id=270&fname=habitat_suitability.png&access=public,REQUIRED: The person responsible for the metadata information.REQUIRED: The organization responsible for the metadata information.REQUIRED: The telephone number by which individuals can speak to the organization or individual.REQUIRED: The city of the address.REQUIRED: The state or province of the address.REQUIRED: The ZIP or other postal code of the address.,,,,

They are included here to show the available horizontal extent of lidar-derived topo-bathymetric data and thus explicitly identify gaps and limitations of predicted corridor extents under various reduced lake level scenarios. In addition, these files provide users with a background layer that depicts the topographic variability of the submerged near-shore lake bed and terrestrial landscape.These files are 5m grid representations of the hydrographic and topographic data collected by the CHARTS system along the coasts of the U.S. sides of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario as part of the National Coastal Mapping Program. Similar data exist for portions of the Lake Superior coastal zone, but are not viewable on the interactive maps associated with this online resourse.The 5m grid representation of the data are based on the ASCII xyz files containing the hydrographic data and the topographic last return (TL) data. An example file name is \""2007_NCMP_MI_Huron_47_5mGrid.tif .\"" The data file names are based on the year, project, area name, box number, and product type. Data were collected from 2006 to 2010, and for multiple dates along portions of the above listed lakes' coastal zones as well as their connecting channels.  These data do not represent spatially complete contiguous coverages along the entire coast, and are limited where turbidity or aquatic vegetation prevented light penetration through the water column when flights were conducted.Where multiple date data were available, the year's data whose bathymetric coverage were most complete were used preferentially as the primary year, and the alternate year's data were used to fill any gaps imposed by turbidity or aquatic vegetation in the primary year. In these cases, the tiles file name reflects the two years' coincident data, with the first year listed in the file name representing the primary year selected.The data were collected and processed in geographic coordinates and ellipsoid heights. The positions are provided relative to NAD83 in decimal degrees of longitude and latitude. The heights were converted from ellipsoid to orthometric heights (NAVD88) using NGS' Geoid03 model file \""g2003u08.bin\"" with the results in meters.

This will be accomplished by aggregating suitable ground-water data from local, state, and federal organizations. A consensus-based framework document (http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html) was developed to provide guidance to ensure that the data are comparable and can be included in a nationally consistent network. The framework design focuses on providing information needed to assess the quantity of ground-water reserves as constrained by quality. The scale of the network will focus on Principal and Major Aquifers of the United States. Five Pilots tested the concepts outlined in the Framework document for the NGWMN. The Pilot areas were the Mahomet-Teays aquifer in Illinois and Indiana, the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer in southeastern Minnesota, and statewide aquifers in Montana, New Jersey, and Texas. A pilot Network portal was developed using data from the 5 pilots and included data contributed by 9 organizations. An important aspect of the Network portal is that the portal is not an aggregated database of data from all participants, but it is a gateway to the data as it is maintained and served by each participating organization. Original data are retrieved from each data provider by the portal in real time. The portal is capable of displaying water levels, well logs, and water quality in tabular or graphical formats and allows the user to bulk download all of the available data. Users may select water-level and water-quality wells by subnetwork and based on the Agency collecting the data or the Principal aquifer. Most wells are classified into \""Background\"", \""Suspected/Anticipated Change\"" or \""Known Changes\"" subnetworks. Within these subnetworks, wells are categorized as either \""Trend\"" or \""Surveillance\"", based on the monitoring frequency.",ground water United States,     ,,###http://cida.usgs.gov/gw_data_portal/######http://slrfvm.glos.us/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get?uuid=f6455e4a-f790-4843-8377-03ca36276511&fname=&access=private,2014-02-14T18:08:31,,http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=f6455e4a-f790-4843-8377-03ca36276511&fname=NGWMN_s.png###http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=f6455e4a-f790-4843-8377-03ca36276511&fname=NGWMN.png,U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States###Kathy KochLimnoTechData Curatorkrkoch@limno.com,,-171.1171875###-51.234375###19.515625###79.6328125,,

This program will allow Ohio to establish baseline conditions and track progress of GLRI and other efforts along Lake Erie. This effort also ties into Annex 11 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), which calls for a comprehensive surveillance and monitoring program for the Great Lakes to evaluate water quality trends, assess the effectiveness of remedial programs, measure compliance with jurisdictional regulatory programs, identify emerging problems and support development of RAPs and LaMPs. The monitoring strategy was designed over a three-year cycle to define environmental conditions in the dynamic nearshore areas.  Experience and data gathered will serve as the baseline to integrate annual Lake Erie monitoring into the State of Ohio’s Water Quality Monitoring Strategy.  The project builds on the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment framework by adding ambient sites and additional parameters, including plankton.  Subsequent years focus on harbors, bays and estuaries, as well as evaluation of biological communities at various trophic levels.  Ohio EPA completed the first round of sampling in 2011 and will continue additional sampling rounds in 2012 and 2013.  Results from the first two rounds of sampling will be summarized in Ohio EPA’s 2014 Integrated Report.",surface water nutrients Ohio,     ,1998-01-22T12:41:00,###http://wwwapp.epa.ohio.gov/dsw/gis/wq/index.php######http://slrfvm.glos.us/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get?uuid=72b2d8f5-e21d-4815-8014-02a4df5d1075&fname=&access=private,2014-02-14T18:14:51,,http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=72b2d8f5-e21d-4815-8014-02a4df5d1075&fname=OhioSurfaceWater_s.png###http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=72b2d8f5-e21d-4815-8014-02a4df5d1075&fname=OhioSurfaceWater.png,"Amy Jo KleiOhio Environmental Protection AgencyDivision of Surface Water614-644-2871P.O.

This narrative has been prepared to bring context to the work done by the Recreational Boating and Tourism Technical Working Group (TWG) of the International Upper Great Lakes Study. The Recreation Boating and Tourism TWG has identified four Performance Indicators (PI) to help better understand the effect water level changes in the Upper Great Lakes will have on recreational boating and tourism in the region. These PI’s are 1) Coastal Tourism; 2) Great Lakes Cruising; 3) Marinas; and 4) Boat launches. These indicators emerged as the most likely factors to be affected by change in Great Lakes’ water levels.

 iso19139,5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700,1363,Water Toxicity in the St. Lawrence River at Massena Area of Concern," Description of Work  Past water-quality issues in the St. Lawrence River at Massena, NY resulted in a determination that selected beneficial uses may be impaired in a surrounding Area of Concern (AOC) and on the Canadian side of the international boundary (Cornwall, Ontario). The plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) was so designated because impairment metrics were unavailable or inconclusive. Recent investigations, however, suggest that plankton communities are relatively healthy and no longer threaten the local ecosystem. Thus, the BUI for plankton may now be outdated in all, or parts of, the St. Lawrence River in the Massena AOC. The primary goal for the Massena (and Cornwall) Remedial Action Plan (RAP) (developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the Massena Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), the Canadian governments, the Cornwall Public Advisory Committee (PAC), and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne) is to &quot;restore, protect, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the St. Lawrence River ecosystem and in particular the Akwesasne, Cornwall-Lake St.Francis and Massena Area of Concern in accordance with the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and other agency laws, regulations, and policies&quot;. The RAP established specific criteria in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC for delisting (restoring and protecting) the &quot;Degradation of Phytoplanton and Zooplankton Populations&quot; BUI. These criteria are: (1) &quot;phytoplankton or zooplankton community structure does not significantly differ from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical characteristics&quot;, and (2) &quot;in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters (i.e. no growth inhibition)&quot;. This study generated toxicity data needed to test hypotheses that (1) waters at all sample locations in the AOC are not toxic to plankton and (2) the toxicity of waters at all sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to plankton than are waters from upstream control reaches (in three selected main tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River), which are not within the AOC. Toxicity of waters to plankton from all study sites will be quantified by the (a) growth of the green algae species, Selenastrum capricornutum and (b) reproductive capacity (and survival) of Ceriodaphnia dubia using standard United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidelines. Statistical analyses that test both hypotheses will be used to determine if waters within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet the second criterion for delisting the plankton BUI. <br /> &nbsp;",beneficial use impairment Plankton Bioassay St. Lawrence River Plankton Area of Concern Ceriodaphnia dubia Toxicity Test Selenastrum capricornutum Great Lakes Restoration Initiative GLRI Beneficial use impairment Areas of concern Lake Lake:Lake Ontario Toxic Substances Uploaded in Batch Template 146 Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,,,"###https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700######http://ny.cf.er.usgs.gov/nyprojectsearch/projects/2457-E5211-1.html######http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/######http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/#/Browse/fats/5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700######https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint######javascript:addWMSLayer([[\""ScienceBase WMS Service\"",\""https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0\"", \""ScienceBase WMS Service\"",\""1363\""]])###/metadata/srv/eng/google.kml?uuid=5359818fe4b0031b2f4a0700&layers=ScienceBase WMS Service",2018-10-12T18:44:30,,,Barry P BaldigoBiologist (RGE)5182855601425 Jordan RoadTroyNY12180USbbaldigo@usgs.govhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/directory/person/445###Edward F BugliosiChief NY Water Science Center - Ithaca607266052130 Brown RoadIthacaNY14850USebuglios@usgs.govhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/directory/person/1331###U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/directory/organization/18276###New York State Department of Environmental Conservation###St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne,,-79.7826774135###-76.0599134294###43.181705156###44.2328185396,,

The identified needs focused on items that could have been used to improve the Lake Superior regulation decisions within the IUGLS. The Coastal Zone TWG noted that a complimentary component of adaptive management is setting up systems and strategies to actually reduce vulnerabilities (as opposed to managing the hazard itself (i.e. water levels)). Since activities to reduce vulnerabilities are largely outside the control of the IJC, the white paper did not specifically address such adaptive management options.","ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT, COASTAL AREAS, MODELLING, MONITORING",Access constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed  Use constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed   ,,###http://iugls.org/DocStore/ProjectArchive/CZN_CoastalZone/CZN11_CoastalZoneAMNeeds/Reports/CZN11-R1_Shantz_CoastalAMOptions.pdf,2014-03-10T16:22:55,,,Mike ShantzEnvironment CanadaCanadian Co-leadmike.shantz@ec.gc.ca###Mike ShantzEnvironment CanadaMetadata Authormike.shantz@ec.gc.ca,,-93.21###-74.49###40.39###50.74,,

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. An update to the original version was initiated when generation of NLCD 2006 data products identified some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. Questions about the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",Imperviousness GIS U.S. Geological Survey USGS digital spatial data imageryBaseMapsEarthCover 010 United States U.S. US,"Access constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed  Use constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed  Other constraints Access Constraints: None Use Constraints: None Distribution  Liability: Although these data  have been processed successfully on a computer  system at the USGS, no warranty  expressed or implied is made by the USGS regarding the use of the data on any other system, nor does the act of distribution  constitute any such warranty.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThe installation and management of dams threatens the diversity of native Great Lakes fish by restricting or eliminating connectivity between the lakes and critical spawning, nursery, and overwintering habitats. Tributaries also provide water, nutrients, and sediment to the Great Lakes, particularly to coastal and near-shore ecosystems. Although limitation of fish passage and denial of fish access to the upper watershed are important consequences of dams, these influences are difficult to quantify and so the influence of tributary dams as a stressor is limited in this analysis to those effects associated with altered delivery of sediments, nutrients and organic matter. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377. -http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSince the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, ballast water release from ocean vessels is the most probable vector for almost two-thirds of invasions, including some of the most notorious Great Lakes invaders such as zebra and quagga mussels and round gobies. Because of the importance of ballast water release as an invasion pathway, control measures have been enacted. Ballast water exchange (BWE), the exchange of fresh or estuarine water with sea water to purge or kill organisms in ballast tanks, has been required since 1993. Saltwater flushing instituted after 2006 further requires sea water rinsing of ballast tanks of Great Lake-bound ships. The effectiveness of these control measures remains a matter of debate, although the importance of ballast water as a pathway likely is diminishing. However, ballast discharges from ships confined to the Great Lakes account for 95% of all ballast water discharges and may facilitate the secondary transport of species that have already been introduced.

PCBs were widely used as coolants and insulating fluids and in a variety of other industrial uses, but their manufacture and importation to North American ended in 1977-1980. As with other restricted legacy organochlorines, they are extremely resistant to degradation and persist for decades in the environment. Like methylmercury, PCBs bioaccumulate rapidly through food chains, resulting in restrictions on fish consumption and concerns for wildlife health.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

We combine active and historic metal mines due to the potentially long legacy effect and often lesser regulatory restriction on historic metal mines. We also include limestone/dolomite mines, even though chemical leaching is not expected to be serious, because of the land disturbance associated with these mining operations and the large footprint of some mines. Calcite Quarry located in Rogers City, MI, on the shore of Lake Huron is the worlds largest limestone mine. Quarries for excavating sand, gravel and stones make up the vast majority of mines in the Great Lakes region, but they are not considered as a stressor here because they are unlikely to result in significant disturbance or contamination. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

The WMO ice chart archiving formats are the Sea Ice Grid (SIGRID) format developed in 1981 and formalized in 1989 and its successor SIGRID-2. The National Ice Center digital Ice Analysis charts (Hemispheric, Regional and Daily are encoded in SIGRID-3 and have two main components: the shapefile containing the Ice Analysis ice information (ice polygons and related attributes) and the metadata describing the Ice Analysis data under the SIGRID-3 format. The National Ice Center legacy ice data set contains hemispheric spatial data files from 1972 through 2004 inclusive. Regional Spatial data files of the traditional \""seas\""(ex Beaufort Sea) have been available since 1997. Legacy data are available in various formats from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado ( http://nsidc.org/ ). Legacy Great Lakes charts are available from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan  ( http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/ ). Currently (October, 2006), spatial data files are available for each hemisphere, and for each sub-regional area, of which there are approximately 62.  The ice analyses for each sea or sub-sea are also available in a jpeg format.  They represent the ice conditions for the week in which they are published.  Data for the analyses can go back 96 hours from when they are completed. They are dated with the week they are published. They are based on an analysis and integration of all available data on ice conditions, including weather and oceanographic information, visual observations from shore, ship and aircraft, airborne radar, satellite imagery and climatological information. The Regional Ice Analyses describe areas of differing ice conditions using the WMO ice observing standards, and indicate where significant changes in the amount, stage of development and form of the predominant ice types have occurred. The Regional Ice Analyses for all of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere Seas are produced every other week. The analyses for the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, Arctic Basin (High Arctic), Northern East Greenland, Barents, Kara and White Seas and the Cook Inlet are produced at least weekly. The Ross Sea is produced weekly during Austral Summer navigation season. The Chesapeake and Delaware Bay areas are produced weekly when there is ice. The analyses for the Great Lakes (when there is ice and in collaboration with the Canadian Ice Service), the Bering Sea, the Cook Inlet and the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are produced twice per week when there is an ice edge present.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgCombined sewers that collect sanitary sewage and stormwater runoff into a single pipe system are found in many Great Lakes cities, where overflows can occur during heavy storms. Under wet weather conditions, high stormwater volumes may result in the discharge of untreated sewer waste into surface waters. In addition, stormwater may contribute pollutants such as oil and grease from vehicles, fecal bacteria from pet and wildlife waste, and pesticides and lawn chemicals that accumulate on diffuse surfaces during dry periods. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSummer surface water temperatures appear to be increasing across the Great Lakes basin, with greater increases in the upper relative to the lower Great Lakes. Moreover, summer water temperatures appear to be warming at a faster rate than mean annual air temperatures in the upper Great Lakes, evidently due to an earlier onset of summer stratification, which may last longer and become established at shallower depths. Model projections indicate surface temperature warming between 2000 and 2100 ranging from 0.37-0.93°C per decade in Lake Superior to between 0.20 and 0.60°C per decade in Lake Erie. Temperature changes will affect the metabolism of ectothermic organisms, alter the ranges and abundances of many species due to changes in thermal habitat, affect the timing of seasonal events such as spring blooms of algae, and promote the spread of nuisance algae and invasive species. Some changes may be beneficial, however, as warmer temperatures likely will increase ecosystem productivity unless nutrients or other factors become limiting, and may expand the thermal habitat available to some native fishes.

Seasonally the lakes vary by 0.40 to 0.45 m. However, the Lakes have experienced considerable water level fluctuations in the past three decades relative to the 2-m range, with extreme high water in the 1970s-1990s. Lake levels dramatically declined between 1997 and 2000, and are now near their recorded low. Shallow, near-shore regions of the lakes, including wetlands and river mouths, are particularly vulnerable to declines in water levels, which may result in increased demand for dredging. Although short-term lake level fluctuations can be beneficial to wetland biodiversity, prolonged change is likely to cause zonation shifts, the consequences of which will depend in part on lake bathymetry.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377. http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThe USEPA and EC designated 43 AOCs under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a binational agreement to ensure the long-term maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes Ecosystem. Sediment contamination is the most common cause of AOC listing. AOCs range in size from those covering entire watersheds to portions of watersheds, segments of rivers, stretches of shoreline and individual bays and harbors. Generally, the AOCs are associated with a river mouth, and their area of influence in the lakes themselves is largely undefined. However, sediment contamination is generally localized at river mouths and harbor areas of human dominated watersheds, where fine-grained sediments have been deposited over time.  As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

While the duration of winter ice cover has unquestionably decreased over the past century at locations including Grand Traverse Bay, MI, and Lake Superior in the vicinity of Bayfield, WI, trends across the surface of the Great Lakes are more complex. One measure, the annual maximum percentage of lake surface covered by ice, is highest in Lake Erie, despite having the fewest freezing degree days (FDDs), due to its shallow mean depth (19 m); Lake Superior ranks second, because its high FDDs offset its greater mean depth (148 m). Relative ranking for the five Great Lakes also has changed across decades. Although further analysis is needed, evidence to date and future projections suggest reductions in ice cover extent and duration characteristic of mild past winters, and Lakes Erie and Superior may show the greatest response.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \""provisional\"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Land Cover (Version 2.0) for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. An update to the original version was initiated when generation of NLCD 2006 data products identified some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.

Phosphorus inputs to the Great Lakes are represented by TP, and include both tributary and atmospheric inputs.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors.

Using this approach, stations for water column sampling were selected from homogenous areas of each lake where routine variability in lake conditions would not likely mask actual changes.In addition to the routine monitoring stations, “master stations” have been identified in each major lake basin.  (Master stations are indicated with an “M” following the station ID.)  The routine monitoring stations are referred to as non-master stations.   Most of the current master stations represent the deepest point within its lake basin.  These stations are sampled at more frequent depths to provide GLNPO with a better means of characterizing vertical conditions during each survey.  Samples are taken annually at each spring sampling site (in open water) and analysis is done for the following parameters of relevance: TSS,particulate nitrogen,particulate phosphorus,TP,DRP,nitrates,Chlorophyll a, also TP and Tn in sediments.

The stocking of non-native salmonines may provide vectors for disease and parasite introductions and for disease and parasite spread throughout the Great Lakes owing to the mobility of stocked salmonines. Further, non-native salmonines may compete with native fishes for food and spawning habitat and may cause excessive mortality to native prey and competitor species. On the other hand, stocked non-native salmonines are among the most effective controls of alewife and rainbow smelt abundances and have facilitated the recovery of native fishes in Lakes Huron and Michigan. Non-native salmonines also play a key role in the regional economy through support of profitable sport fisheries. Hence, non-native salmonine stocking plays an ambiguous ecological role with the potential to both harm native species and to facilitate rehabilitation of diminished, threatened, or extirpated native species.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgInvasive common reed Phragmites australissubspeciesaustralisforms dense monocultures which crowd out native plants, inhibit animal movement, serve as a poor quality food for animals, and slow decomposition. In freshwater habitats, evidence suggests decreases in turtle, bird, and amphibian populations, plant diversity, nutrient cycling and microhabitat conditions. While several genotypes of P. australis(subspeciesamericanus) are native to North America, exotic genotypes (particularly haplotype M from Europe) have been present in the Great Lakes region since the 1910s and expanded rapidly starting in the 1960s, nearly entirely displacing the native genotypes. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.","environmental impacts stress weeds, noxious plants or invasive plants invasive species Great Lakes Laurentian Great Lakes Lake Huron Lake Erie Lake Superior 1866-2011 Laurentian Great Lakes Great Lakes GLEAM stress impact environment invasive species phragmites models","Use limitation The Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping  (GLEAM)  project prepared and used information for its own purposes  and this information may not be suitable  for other purposes.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) invaded Lake Ontario in the early 19thcentury and expanded throughout the Great Lakes in the mid-20thcentury. The sea lamprey is considered one of the most detrimental invasive species to enter the Great Lakes, and is known to parasitize lake trout, non-native salmonines, lake whitefish, lake herring, rainbow trout, burbot and walleye. Although the sea lamprey was not solely responsible for all population collapse of lake trout, it is currently a major impediment to lake trout rehabilitation efforts. The abundance and distribution of sea lampreys throughout the Great Lakes has not been determined. However, adults enter rivers to spawn, and spawning numbers are estimated from surveys and modeling. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) first appeared in the Great Lakes in Lake St. Clair in 1986, followed by quagga mussels (D. bugensis) in 1989. Dreissena colonization has resulted in a number of physical and chemical changes to the Great Lakes. Colonization adds habitat complexity for benthic invertebrates and creates a hard substrate in soft-sediment systems. Chemical impacts are complex and variable, as numerous studies have found dreissenid effects on total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate, turbidity and chlorophyll levels. When in high density, dreissenids appear to cause chlorophyll declines and shunt pelagic algal production into benthic mussel biomass, possibly reducing food availability to upper trophic levels and thus limiting fish productivity. In addition, dreissenids may facilitate growth of the nuisance algae Microcystis aeruginosaand Cladophora glomeratadue to increased water clarity, although the public may perceive greater underwater visibility as a benefit.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

Hypoxia usually occurs during late summer due to the decomposition of organic matter leading to oxygen depletion. Human-induced nutrient enrichment, particularly from elevated phosphorus inputs, has increased the frequency and areal extent of hypoxia. Because DO > 4 mg.L-1is unlikely to be stressful to the majority of species, we estimated relative stress due to hypoxia using the continuous range of DO values and a scale from 1 (no stress, > 4 mg.L-1) to 0 (maximum stress, 0 mg/L).As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

Personal interviews with marina owners and operators as well as depth measurements at slips were completed at a total of seventeen areas of survey (AOS) spread along Lakes Erie, Huron and Superior; ten in Canada and seven in the United States of America. Based on the responses to questionnaires completed by 111 marina owner/operators (77 Canadian, and 34 U.S.A.), this report summarizes regional industry characteristics of the different sample areas, their experience with historical episodes of fluctuating water levels, as well as their responses to different scenarios of water level fluctuations pertaining to damages and adaptations. Physical depth measurements from 125 marinas (88 Canadian, and 37 U.S.A.) yielded regional slip-loss estimates for three incremental one foot (0.3m) drop scenarios below the 2009 average elevation during the boating season. Using the physical depth measurements, each marina’s set of slip measurements were subjected to three scenarios of one foot (0.3m) interval drops below the host Lake’s 2009 average elevation for the months during which surveys were completed.  The number of slips with less than two feet (0.6m) of water after a one foot (0.3m), two foot (0.6m) and three foot (0.9m) drop from this average were considered to be unusable.  Finally, this measure, as well as the costs reported in the operators’ responses, was used to generate rough economic loss estimates related to the three drop scenarios.",COPING ZONES SLIP DEPTHS WATER-LEVEL DEPTHS ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ECONOMIC IMPACT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WATER-LEVEL LAKE SUPERIOR LAKE HURON LAKE ERIE LAKE MICHIGAN GEORGIAN BAY,     ,2009-01-01T00:00:002011-08-15T00:00:00,###http://www.iugls.org/files/tinymce/uploaded/PeerReview_pdfs/Boating%20Impact%20Analysis%20-%20Peer%20Review.pdf,2014-03-10T14:12:22,,http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=5e5d7296-3963-4587-9949-c3b98c7dedd6&fname=RecBoating_s.png###http://data.glos.us/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=5e5d7296-3963-4587-9949-c3b98c7dedd6&fname=RecBoating.png,Glenn WarrenTourism and Environmental Resource Management Systems (T.E.R.M.S.)Data Steward(705) 670-0755glenn.warren@persona.ca###Glenn WarrenMetadata Authorglenn.warren@persona.ca,,-93.21###-74.49###40.39###50.74,,

Stressors include the amount of agricultural and developed land use, as well as road and population density. These summaries are based on a set of 5971 watersheds that cover the US and Canadian Great Lakes basin, derived using methods from Hollenhorst et al. (2007). Indices presented in this dataset include SumRel (Host et al 2007) and the more recent combined Agriculture and Development - AgDev index (Host et al. In Prep).A brief description of the AgDev \""Euclidean Distance\"" stressor integration, with R code, is here: https://github.com/NRRI/stressor_lib/tree/master/euc_distanceUse agdevbasn in preference to sumrel. For historical reference, for sumrel: we evaluated a number of normalizing transformations for each variable, including log, ln, and arcsine transformations. The use of high-resolution watersheds resulted in a large number of zeros (i.e. non-occurrence of the stressor) for many of the variables. The best results were obtained using a log10 transformation of non-zero values. Each of the five variables data values (x) were transformed to log10 (x), using the minimum non-zero value of x to replace zero values. These transformed (x') values were then standardized, (x'-m)/s, with m and s being the mean and standard-deviation for all x', respectively. These standardized values (x'') were then normalized, (x''-min)/(max-min), with min and max being the minimum and maximum for all x'', respectively. Finally the five x'' values for each variable in each watershed were summed and the summed values normalized again to give a single number - SUMREL - for each watershed. SUMREL ranges from 0.0-1.0, with 1.0 representing the maximum composite stress within a geographic coverage of interest. Note that this design allows stressor scores to be calculated for any given spatial extent - from local watersheds to an ecoregion, lake, or basin.",Downloadable Data Great Lakes stress environment GLOS_funded mini-DMAC aquatic ecosystems watershed/drainage basin environmental,,,###http://data.nrri.umn.edu/data/dataset/ws5971agdev######http://data.glos.us/metadata?uuid=90930f66-591b-4a0a-b3c9-fc5c8f6b165,2017-01-18T17:37:38,,,"NRRI GIS LabNRRI, University of Minnesota - Duluthcustodian###NRRI GIS-Lab.218-788-26755013 Miller Trunk HighwayDuluthMinnesota55804nrgisl.nrri@gmail.com",,-93.451757###-72.660545###39.29063###50.94188,,

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgCoastal development disrupts physical and hydrodynamic processes and generates pollutants that, due to lake proximity, may introduce diverse contaminants into near shore waters. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgGreat Lakes ports and harbors are connected by a complex network of shipping lanes, locks and navigation channels that allow ships to travel over 3000 km from Duluth, MN, to the Atlantic Ocean. Environmental impacts associated with shipping lanes include shoreline erosion from wave action caused by passing ships, substrate disturbance due to propeller wash in shallow areas, habitat degradation from ice-breaking and winter navigation, and pollution from ship discharges. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

These data are derived from meteorological and hydrological data. The 1993 reference is an update of the earlier report describing Great Lakes monthly hydrologic data. It was expanded and revised to include all available data through 1990 and to reflect improved computational techniques. The raw data utilized were collected from several sources, so the periods of record for each lake vary.While most of these data are available in the referenced reports, some of the data are not included in the report. These data may be available directly from GLERL. Daily values of some of these parameters may also be available from GLERL on a limited basis. These data were derived from quality controlled input data (see reference) and are periodically updated to reflect additional data and to extend the period of record. Note that missing data in the *.CIS files is denoted by -9999. This only occurs in December of the last year. Coverage includes Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and Lake St.Clair. Note: Most files have been updated through 1999. All data is now presented in spreadsheet format (MS-Excel 97 format). Some additional data types not present in the published report are also included in the data archive. Earlier versions of some of the spreadsheets (through 1995) are available as well (in the ArchivedFiles directory).",hydrologic hydrology air temperature change in storage cloud cover evaporation connecting channels diversions water levels net basin supply nbs precipitation runoff water temperature wind speed Lake Superior Lake Michigan Lake Huron Lake Erie Lake Ontario Lake St.Clair,     ,1860-01-22T11:35:002008-01-22T11:35:00,###http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/arc/hydro/mnth-hydro.html######http://slrfvm.glos.us/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get?uuid=0e8af0d8-708e-4fc4-b39d-6505b5b8e707&fname=&access=private,2013-09-20T15:35:56,,,Tim HunterNOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research LaboratoryIT Specialist734-741-23444840 S.

The SGB Dataset contains the entire shoreline delineated and classified to match Stewart’s classification scheme (Stewart C.J., 2002). Coldwater used high resolution aerial imagery, provided by Simcoe County, to identify and classify shore protection structures. A field survey of shore protection structures for Wasaga Beach, Collingwood, and Lafontaine was performed by Coldwater on 26 August 2010. Where appropriate, survey data, such as structure condition, composition, crest and toe elevations, and distance from the water’s edge, was added to the dataset. This survey provided the statistics of crest elevations for this study area. The Wasaga Beach study site is located on Georgian Bay of Lake Huron and includes the entire shoreline of Wasaga Beach and Collingwood. The Western boundary is defined by the municipal borders of Collingwood and The Blue Mountains, and the Eastern boundary is defined by the municipal borders of Wasaga Beach and Tiny.

The building outlines were manually digitized from a combination of 2008 and 2006 orthoimagery in the area. The shoreline was extracted from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 'Wateredg' data layer. The 2008 imagery was the Simcoe 2008 30cm resolution imagery and the 2006 data was the SWOOP imagery. Efforts were made to consistently and accurately capture the building outline but some challenges occurred including vegetation cover blocking building extent and shadows and image angle impacting building footprint identification.,COASTAL AREAS DIGITAL DATA GIS STUDY SITES COLLINGWOOD-WASAGA BEACH,Access constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed  Use constraints Other restrictions: Limitation not listed   ,,###http://iugls.org/DocStore/ProjectArchive/CZN_CoastalZone/CZN04_CoastalZoneSiteCharacterization/Additional_Archived/Data/buildingfootprint_150mtoshoreline_CWB.zip,2014-03-10T14:27:55,,,Mike ShantzEnvironment CanadaEnvironmental Resource Analystmike.shantz@ec.gc.ca###Mike ShantzEnvironment CanadaMetadata Authormike.shantz@ec.gc.ca,,-93.21###-74.49###40.39###50.74,,

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgMarinas are a potential source of chemical pollution due to boat maintenance activities and spillage of a variety of compounds, and may exert physical effects on the environment associated with boat wakes, harbor dredging, breakwaters and shoreline structures. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.",environmental impacts stress chemical spills Great Lakes Laurentian Great Lakes Lake Huron Lake Erie Lake Superior 2010 Laurentian Great Lakes Great Lakes GLEAM stress impact environment marinas pollution chemical spills models,"Use limitation The Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping  (GLEAM)  project prepared and used information for its own purposes  and this information may not be suitable  for other purposes.

Our first municipal water plant and distribution system were placed into service in 1884. However, at the time water was simply pumped out of the Black River into the wooden pipes of the distribution system without treatment. A typhoid epidemic in 1893 was believed to have resulted from the lack of filtration. In 1896 construction of a water purification plant was authorized. Lorain became the first plant in the United States to start construction for the express purpose of filtering all the water to remove bacteria. The primary source for the potable water intake was switched to Lake Erie with the Black River intake as only a secondary source. Today, all water is drawn from a crib 26.5ft deep and 2,800 feet out in Lake Erie from outside the breakwall. A YSI EXO2 sonde is installed in the lake pump station for the city of Lorain, Ohio. The sensor is located approximately 6ft below the water surface and was installed on January 27, 2018 and is part of the GLOS Lake Erie HABs monitoring network.","water temperature ph conductivity chlorophyll turbidity water quality dissolved gasses cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) Longitude -82.19 Latitude 41.47 Lake Erie Great Lakes lelorain Lorain, OH HABs Harmful Algal Blooms GLOS water temperature pH conductivity chlorophyll turbidity water quality Lake Erie Great Lakes blue-green algae cyanobacteria habs observationsBuoys temperature water_quality ysi_chlorophyll WaterTemperature ysi_turbidity ph water_conductivity dissolved_oxygen_saturation dissolved_oxygen ysi_blue_green_algae",,2018-03-05,###http://data.glos.us/habs######http://data.glos.us/metadata?uuid=3b5cc334-26fe-4166-839c-17e76efa5d6e######http://glbuoys.glos.us/lelorain######http://tds.glos.us/thredds/dodsC/buoy_agg_standard/lelorain/lelorain.ncml######http://tds.glos.us/thredds/dodsC/buoy_agg_standard/lelorain/lelorain.ncml.html######http://tds.glos.us/thredds/sos/buoy_agg/lelorain/lelorain.ncml,2019-03-11T19:28:00,,http://data.glos.us:80/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=24d95510-9c9c-4126-adb6-590faebf2bb0&fname=sondes_sm_s.png###http://data.glos.us:80/metadata/srv/eng/resources.get?uuid=24d95510-9c9c-4126-adb6-590faebf2bb0&fname=sondes.png,"City of Lorain, Ohio###Ed VerhammeLimnoTech501 Avis Dr.Ann ArborMI48108everhamme@limno.com###Kathy KochLimnoTech / GLOSData Curator734-332-1200Ann ArborMIkkoch@limno.com",2018-03-05,-82.19###-82.19###41.47###41.47,,

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgCommercial fishing in the Great Lakes has experienced dramatic changes in target species and harvests due to the combined influences of over-fishing, invasive species and environmental deterioration. Lake Erie supports the largest and most heavily managed commercial fisheries, focused on yellow perch and walleye, and has seen recent recovery of its lake whitefish fishery. Current fisheries emphasize yellow perch and lake whitefish in Lake Ontario; lake whitefish, walleye and yellow perch in areas of Lakes Huron and Michigan; and cisco, lake trout and lake whitefish in Lake Superior. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km.

Untreated water samples are collected weekly and analyzed at MOE labs. This program contributes to the assessment of taste and odor issues and the potential for algal toxin production in drinking water. Since the program started in 1976, the data generated have been used for measuring the response of near-shore water quality to phosphorus controls, climate change and invasion by exotic species such as zebra and quagga mussels. file with the coordinates for the five Lake Erie water treatment plants.",water quality monitoring TP NH4+NH3 NO3 NO2+NO3 NO2 TKN reactive P phytoplankton Canada,     ,1976-01-22T11:56:00,###http://slrfvm.glos.us/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get?uuid=6c2f130c-737b-4b1f-ae57-5d86a622ce99&fname=&access=private,2013-09-20T14:28:07,,,"Duncan BoydGreat Lakes Monitoring UnitSupervisor, GL Monitoring416-235-6221125 Resources Rd.TorontoONM9P3V6Canadaduncan.boyd@ontario.ca###Kathy KochLimnoTechData Curatorkrkoch@limno.com",,-93.16640625###-75.4125###42.92828125###50.31109375,,

 iso19139,5cc9c121-dcbc-44e3-aaa1-94eb14d97218,124,Canadian Important Bird Areas,"This layer represents *generalized* boundaries of Important Bird Areas (IBA) in Canada.  IBAs, in Canada and elsewhere, are evaluated and designated on the basis of internationally criteria.  The polygons contained in the dataset meet these criteria and are therefore deemed significant at the national, continental, or global level.  In Canada, IBAs are not legally recognized entities and therefore do not have any regulatory status.  Nevertheless, they are extremely useful for conservation planning for birds.  Polygon boundaries were digitized on-screen in ArcView GIS 3.2 by using NTDB 1:50K or 1:250K digital layers for reference.  If NTDB coverage was not available (e.g., far north), the Digital Chart of the World (1:1M) was used.  The boundaries of IBAs in this dataset are intentionally generalized to reflect the importance of the surrounding ecosystem on the values present within IBAs.  For example, small islands supporting colonies of seabirds might be buffered by 1 or 2 km to form an IBA.  Boundaries for a very small minority of IBAs were available in paper form as part of IBA conservation plans that had been developed previously.  In such cases, we visually estimated their boundaries against the NTDB or other base layers.  Many IBAs are already recognized as other types of protected areas, e.g., National Wildlife Areas, National and Provincial Parks, Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and so on.  In these cases, we used digital boundaries from other sources (e.g., WWF Canada's Designated Areas Database, Environment Canada's Canadian Conservation Areas Database) as reference points when digitizing IBA boundaries.

For the Landsat series, the ground trace of the orbit is described by the WRS-2 grid or index, (also known as WRS-II, World Reference System Two).  It consists of 233 unique orbit ground traces that are interlaced in 15 daily patterns of 16 orbits.  Therefore, every 16 days the ground traces repeat over the same locations (good for measuring change over time).  Data products from the Landsat series are produced from the strip of data received along a given path by cutting or dividing the data into rectangles or \""granules\"" designated by row numbers for each path.  There are 248 rows to accompany each path.  This data layer represents the area coverage of WRS-2 polygons or Landsat \""footprints\"" over the Great Lakes and connecting waterways. Each rectangle is approximately 185km wide and 175km long Note: Landsat 1-3 produced data tied to the WRS-1 system, which is similar but different.

 fgdc-std,f7852a40-1185-4bc3-a0db-007093062ca7,38,Sturgeon Spawning Grounds-Lake Michigan,"Species occurrence data were obtained from the Atlas of Spawning and Nursery Areas of Great Lakes Fishes (Goodyear et al. 1982).     The atlas contains information on all of the commercially and recreationally important species that use the tributaries, littoral and open-water areas of the Great Lakes as spawning and nursery habitats.   Close to 9500 geo-referenced data records (occurrences of fish species) were imported into ArcView GIS.The 139 fish taxa reported in the Atlas had to be grouped into fewer broad categories to produce meaningful distribution maps.  We chose three functional classification schemes.  Jude and Pappas (1992) used Correspondence Analysis to partition fish species associated with the open water of each of the five Great Lakes and nine coastal wetlands.  Three species complexes were suggested:  a Great Lakes taxocene; a transitional taxocene, which utilized open water, near-shore, and wetlands; and a wetland taxocene.  We chose this as one of the classification schemes because we are particularly interested in identifying the distribution pattern of fish with coastal wetlands; for clarity sake, we have renamed these taxocenes coastal, intermediate and open-water, respectively.   For comparison, we also used Coker et al.’s (2001) classification based on temperature preferenda (5 classes) and Balon’s (1975) reproductive guild classification (32 guilds).",biota sturgeon spawning grounds Lake Michigan Great Lakes,http://gis.glin.net/ogc/services.php#lm_spawn_sturgeon_gsa,-88.000000 -85.416667 41.680000 45.420000,"http://gis.glin.net/geoserver/wms?bbox=-88.000000,41.680000,-85.416667,45.420000&request=GetMap&layers=glin:lm_spawn_sturgeon_gsa&width=600&height=400&srs=EPSG:4326&styles=point_black&format=image/png"",",,,,,,,,
