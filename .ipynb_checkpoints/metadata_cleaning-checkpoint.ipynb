       "  'abstract': '<p>In synoptic surveys of surface-water quality across the United States, a large group of organic chemicals associated with agricultural, household, and industrial waste have been detected. These chemicals are referred to collectively as chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) and include prescription drugs and antibiotics, over-the-counter medications, reproductive hormones, personal-care products, detergent metabolites, and flame retardants.</p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collaborated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on a study to identify the presence of CECs in water and bottom-sediment samples collected during 2012 at 66 sites throughout the Great Lakes Basin. The 2012 effort is part of a long-term study that was initiated in 2010.</p> <p>The purposes of this report are to document the collection and analytical methods, provide the quality-assurance data and analyses, and provide the water and bottom-sediment data for this study of CECs in the Great Lakes Basin for 2012. A previous report documents data collected during 2010 and 2011. The methods used for chemical analyses were identical between the 2010–11 and 2012 studies, with the exception that a method to determine nontarget chemicals was used during 2010–11. The data from this study are published as a USGS Data Series Report to ensure adequate documentation of the original methods and provide a citable source for study data. This report contains no interpretations of the study data. The chemical data are as reported by the laboratory and have not been censored or adjusted unless otherwise noted.</p> <p>Field measurements were recorded and samples were collected in April and May and in September 2012, by U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency personnel. Study sites included tributaries to the Great Lakes located near Duluth, Minnesota; King, Wisconsin; Green Bay, Wis.; Detroit, Michigan; Monroe, Mich.; Toledo, Ohio, and Rochester, New York. Water and bottom-sediment samples were analyzed at the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver, Colorado, for a broad suite of CECs.</p> <p>During this 2012 study, 140 environmental and 8 field duplicate samples of surface water and wastewater effluent, 1 field blank water sample, and 5 field spike water samples were collected or prepared. Water samples were analyzed at the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory using laboratory schedule 4433 for wastewater indicators, research method 8244 for pharmaceuticals, and laboratory schedule 4434 for steroid hormones, sterols, and bisphenol A. For wastewater indicators in unfiltered water, 61 of the 68 chemicals analyzed using laboratory schedule 4433 had detectable concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 64.4 micrograms per liter. Thirty-eight of the 48 chemicals analyzed using research method 8244 for pharmaceuticals in unfiltered water had detectable concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 3.32 micrograms per liter. Twelve of the 20 chemicals analyzed using laboratory schedule 4434 for steroid hormones, sterols, and bisphenol A in unfiltered water had detectable concentrations ranging from 0.43 to 120,000 nanograms per liter.</p> <p>During this study, 53 environmental samples, 4 field duplicate samples, and 8 field spike samples of bottom sediment and laboratory matrix-spike samples were analyzed for a wide variety of CECs at the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory using laboratory schedule 5433 for wastewater indicators; research method 6434 for steroid hormones, sterols, and bisphenol A; and research method 9008 for human-use pharmaceuticals and antidepressants. Forty of the 57 chemicals analyzed using laboratory schedule 5433 had detectable concentrations ranging from 1 to 49,000 micrograms per kilogram. Fourteen of the 20 chemicals analyzed using research method 6434 had detectable concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 24,940 nanograms per gram. Ten of the 20 chemicals analyzed using research method 9008 had detectable concentrations ranging from 0.59 to 197.5 micrograms per kilogram. Five of the 11 chemicals analyzed using research method 9008 had detectable concentrations ranging from 1.16 to 25.0 micrograms per kilogram.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Efforts to improve public health protection in recreational swimming waters have focused on obtaining real-time estimates of water quality. Current monitoring techniques rely on the time-intensive culturing of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from water samples, but rapidly changing FIB concentrations result in management errors that lead to the public being exposed to high FIB concentrations (type II error) or beaches being closed despite acceptable water quality (type I error). Empirical predictive models may provide a rapid solution, but their effectiveness at improving health protection has not been adequately assessed. We sought to determine if emerging monitoring approaches could effectively reduce risk of illness exposure by minimizing management errors. We examined four monitoring approaches (inactive, current protocol, a single predictive model for all beaches, and individual models for each beach) with increasing refinement at 14 Chicago beaches using historical monitoring and hydrometeorological data and compared management outcomes using different standards for decision-making. Predictability (R<sup>2</sup>) of FIB concentration improved with model refinement at all beaches but one. Predictive models did not always reduce the number of management errors and therefore the overall illness burden. Use of a Chicago-specific single-sample standard-rather than the default 235 <i>E. coli</i> CFU/100 ml widely used-together with predictive modeling resulted in the greatest number of open beach days without any increase in public health risk. These results emphasize that emerging monitoring approaches such as empirical models are not equally applicable at all beaches, and combining monitoring approaches may expand beach access.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled “Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan”. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of bathymetric soundings in coastal Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana. Water column depths were measured using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz Rio Grande acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted to a U.S. Geological Survey hydrographic survey vessel. The water column depths from the four diverging beams of the ADCP have been corrected for instrument heading, pitch, and roll and georectified using The Velocity Mapping Toolbox (https://hydroacoustics.usgs.gov/movingboat/VMT/VMT.shtml). Geolocation of the beam soundings was possible using a Hemisphere Crescent A100 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted directly above the ADCP. This GPS receiver has sub-meter horizontal accuracy when operated in differential mode. The edited water column depths were transformed to lake bed elevations using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Calumet Harbor Water Level Gage (9087044) which records at 6-minute intervals. This gage is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the survey site. Bed elevations have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a foot.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Acoustic methods are used to estimate the density of pelagic fish in large lakes with results of midwater trawling used to assign species composition. Apportionment in lakes having mixed species can be challenging because only a small fraction of the water sampled acoustically is sampled with trawl gear. Here we describe a new method where single echo detections (SEDs) are assigned to species based on classification tree models developed from catch data that separate species based on fish size and the spatial habitats they occupy. During the summer of 2011, we conducted a spatially-balanced lake-wide acoustic and midwater trawl survey of Lake Superior. A total of 51 sites in four bathymetric depth strata (0–30 m, 30–100 m, 100–200 m, and &gt;200 m) were sampled. We developed classification tree models for each stratum and found fish length was the most important variable for separating species. To apply these trees to the acoustic data, we needed to identify a target strength to length (TS-to-L) relationship appropriate for all abundant Lake Superior pelagic species. We tested performance of 7 general (i.e., multi-species) relationships derived from three published studies. The best-performing relationship was identified by comparing predicted and observed catch compositions using a second independent Lake Superior data set. Once identified, the relationship was used to predict lengths of SEDs from the lake-wide survey, and the classification tree models were used to assign each SED to a species. Exotic rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) were the most common species at bathymetric depths &lt;100 m with their population estimated at 755 million (3.4 kt). Kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) were the most abundant species at depths &gt;100 m (384 million; 6.0 kt). Cisco (Coregonus artedi) were widely distributed over all strata with their population estimated at 182 million (44 kt). The apportionment method we describe should be transferable to other large lakes provided fish are not tightly aggregated, and an appropriate TS-to-L relationship for abundant pelagic fish species can be determined.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"<p>Between the North American Great Lakes and their tributaries are the places where the confluence of river and lake waters creates a distinct ecosystem: the rivermouth ecosystem. Human development has often centered around these rivermouths, in part, because they provide a rich array of ecosystem services. Not surprisingly, centuries of intense human activity have led to substantial pressures on, and alterations to, these ecosystems, often diminishing or degrading their ecological functions and associated ecological services. Many Great Lakes rivermouths are the focus of intense restoration efforts. For example, 36 of the active Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs) are rivermouths or areas that include one or more rivermouths.</p> <br> <p>Historically, research of rivermouth ecosystems has been piecemeal, focused on the Great Lakes proper or on the upper reaches of tributaries, with little direct study of the rivermouth itself. Researchers have been divided among disciplines, agencies and institutions; and they often work independently and use disparate venues to communicate their work. Management has also been fragmented with a focus on smaller, localized, sub-habitat units and socio-political or economic elements, rather than system-level consideration.</p> <br> <p>This Primer presents the case for a more holistic approach to rivermouth science and management that can enable restoration of ecosystem services with multiple benefits to humans and the Great Lakes ecosystem. A conceptual model is presented with supporting text that describes the structures and processes common to all rivermouths, substantiating the case for treating these ecosystems as an identifiable class.<sup>1</sup> Ecological services provided by rivermouths and changes in how humans value those services over time are illustrated through case studies of two Great Lakes rivermouths—the St. Louis River and the Maumee River. Specific ecosystem services are identified in italics throughout this Primer and follow definitions described by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Table1). Collectively, this primer synthesizes existing information in a new way that aims to support management of rivermouths as distinct and important ecosystems. The development and management decisions made around rivermouths today will shape the future of these ecosystems, and the human communities within them, well into the future.</p> <br> <p><sup>1</sup> The information presented in this paper was derived from discussions and draft documents of the Great Lakes Rivermouth Collaboratory. The Great Lakes Rivermouth Collaboratory was established by the U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center (USGS-GLSC) in collaboration with the Great Lakes Commission to engage the Great Lakes scientific community in sharing and documenting knowledge about freshwater rivermouth ecosystems.

       "  'title': 'Fatty acid composition at the base of aquatic food webs is influenced by habitat type and watershed land use',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Spatial variation in food resources strongly influences many aspects of aquatic consumer ecology. Although large-scale controls over spatial variation in many aspects of food resources are well known, others have received little study. Here we investigated variation in the fatty acid (FA) composition of seston and primary consumers within (i.e., among habitats) and among tributary systems of Lake Michigan, USA. FA composition of food is important because all metazoans require certain FAs for proper growth and development that cannot be produced de novo, including many polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here we sampled three habitat types (river, rivermouth and nearshore zone) in 11 tributaries of Lake Michigan to assess the amount of FA in seston and primary consumers of seston. We hypothesize that among-system and among-habitat variation in FAs at the base of food webs would be related to algal production, which in turn is influenced by three land cover characteristics: 1) combined agriculture and urban lands (an indication of anthropogenic nutrient inputs that fuel algal production), 2) the proportion of surface waters (an indication of water residence times that allow algal producers to accumulate) and 3) the extent of riparian forested buffers (an indication of stream shading that reduces algal production). Of these three land cover characteristics, only intense land use appeared to strongly related to seston and consumer FA and this effect was only strong in rivermouth and nearshore lake sites. River seston and consumer FA composition was highly variable, but that variation does not appear to be driven by the watershed land cover characteristics investigated here. Whether the spatial variation in FA content at the base of these food webs significantly influences the production of economically important species higher in the food web should be a focus of future research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled \\\\\"Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan\\\\\". This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of two-dimensional, near-surface point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach near Chicago, Illinois, on September 22, 2016. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using an EXO2 multiparameter sonde (SN 16F100255) equipped with a version 2 handheld display with a built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (SN 16N999907), temperature/conductivity probe (SN 16C104865), pH sensor (SN 15M100825), optical dissolved oxygen sensor (SN 15L101706), turbidity sensor (SN 16D100455), total algae phycocyanin smart sensor (SN 16C103752), central wiper, and depth sensor. The sonde was deployed off the starboard side of a manned survey vessel using a fixed aluminum mount at a depth of approximately 1.5 feet below the water surface. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the vessel completed the survey of the nearshore zone. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the two-dimensional distributions of near-surface water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists will assess the hydrology, water quality, and response to simulated changes in phosphorus loading of the Winnebago Pool Lakes, Wisconsin. Total annual phosphorus and total suspended sediment loads will be estimated at various monitored locations throughout the Upper Fox and Wolf River Watershed using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR. Monitoring at three new sites was done as part of this study. Data from these three sites will be used to help calibrate the SWAT model for the basin. These loads will be supplied to the Cadmus Group, Inc. to help calibrate SWAT models for the Basin. A detailed water budget will be developed for the Pool Lakes by measuring all major inflow and outflow sources and estimating the magnitude of minor sources. A detailed phosphorus budget will be obtained by quantifying the phosphorus loading associated with each water inflow and outflow source. Loading at each stream monitoring site will be estimated using a rating curve method or GCLAS with streamflow monitored by the USGS and water quality data collected by the Wisconsin DNR. Loading from ungaged areas will be obtained from the SWAT modeling being performed in the basin as part of separate studies by Cadmus Group, Inc. Current water quality (trophic state) of each of the four lakes in the Winnebago Pool will be obtained from the Wisconsin DNR and evaluated relative to long-term trends. The water-quality information will compared to that estimated for the lakes based on the phosphorus loading through the use of selected models in BATHTUB (Walker, 1996). BATHTUB will then be used to simulate the likely response of each of the Pool Lakes to phosphorus loading changes associated with various lake-management actions that might be implemented and specific climate scenarios. Output from the lake to the Lower Fox River will be estimated from data collected by the Wisconsin DNR at Neenah and Menasha and using output from the BATHTUB model. This information will be supplied (as a Final Report/Journal Article) to those developing the TMDL for the Upper Fox River Basin and those modeling the watershed downstream of Lake Winnebago. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists collect real-time, near-real-time, and synoptic flow and water-quality data (sediment and nutrients) from tributaries to the Great Lakes. The data provide baseline information to assess effectiveness of restoration and land management activities. Thirty of the 59 major downstream flow gages are continuously operating for water-quality samplings at these sites (number of sites reduced to 25 effective June 30, 2013). The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information on nutrient and sediment loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries. The USGS nutrient tributary monitoring network follows the National Monitoring Network for Coastal Waters design. Site-specific regression equations are being developed to relate selected laboratory-analyzed analyte concentrations in the discrete samples to measurements recorded by the water-quality monitors. This will enable near-continuous estimates of analytes and allow a reduction in laboratory samples, reducing costs while preserving temporal density of data. This work supports Great Lakes Lakewide Area Management Plans and Remedial Action Plans.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information of current loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> One to three years of data is now available depending on the sites. Water samples collected at the 30 tributary monitoring sites include suspended sediment; nutrients; and chloride. One sample per storm event is analyzed for major ions. At each site, monthly base flow samples are being collected, plus up to eight storms, with 6 samples submitted per storm (60 environmental samples per site). Samples are being used to develop statistical relations between continuously measured parameters and lab analyzed parameters. In-situ water-quality sensors deployed at each site measure turbidity, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH every 15 minutes.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> A preliminary <strong>software package</strong> for development of statistical models for prediction of nutrient and sediment concentrations using real-time sensors was developed and is being tested. This package will be used for exploration of real-time surrogate models at 30 tributaries for up to 6 parameters per site. These models will help in computation of loadings as well as real-time estimates of parameter concentrations. Surrogate parameters include all data from the in-situ water quality sensors, flow, and seasonal variation. This software package will ultimately increase efficiency of initial development and year-to-year validation or recalibration of the real-time surrogate models. Once the package is finalized this summer, it will also be available as an open-source software package for use in the R-statistical computing environment.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

Areas of Concern (AOC) principles and guidelines were developed as an initial reference point from which appropriate restoration criteria could be developed. Stage 2 Remedial Action Plans (RAPs) were developed for each of these AOCs to address impairments to any one of 14 beneficial uses associated with these areas. Specific remediation actions are completed in order to restore the beneficial use. When monitoring data shows a beneficial use is no longer impaired, the state and EPA can remove that BUI. When data shows all identified beneficial use impairments have been eliminated, the EPA can submit a proposal to the International Joint Commission (IJC) for removing the designation of AOC in its entirety. Specific information and measureable indicators are needed in order to demonstrate restoration of the beneficial use. The USGS will meet with State partners, and others, to develop a scientific framework to support decision needs specific to the AOCs, and when possible across multiple AOCs. This may include: determining appropriate measureable indicators, compilation of existing data and information, defining reference conditions, development of decision support framework, discussion of monitoring needed, etc. The Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) where USGS will be most likely to be of help are: fish consumption advisories, fish tumor presence, eutrophication and unwanted algae, drinking water problems, beach health, and concentrations of PCBs in lake trout and walleyes. The other area that we can and are providing support is in assessing new toxic threats. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Great Lakes are a monumentally unique national treasure containing nearly ninety-five percent of the United States' fresh surface water. Formed by receding glaciers, the Great Lakes support a thriving, resilient ecosystem rich with fish, wildlife, and abundant natural resources. The Great Lakes also support an array of commercial uses, including shipping, and provide a source of recreation, drinking water, and other critical services that drive the economy of the region and the Nation. Regrettably, activities such as clear cutting of mature forests, over-harvesting of fish populations, industrial pollution, invasive species, and agricultural runoffs have degraded these treasured lakes over the decades creating long-term impacts to the surrounding watershed. Fortunately, the people who live, work, and recreate in the region recognize the critical importance of a healthy Great Lakes ecosystem, and have come together to support comprehensive restoration. To stimulate and promote the goal of a healthy Great Lakes region, President Obama and Congress created the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) in 2009. This program provides the seed money to clean up legacy pollution, restore habitats, protect wildlife, combat invasive species, and address agricultural runoff in the Great Lakes watershed. At the same time GLRI promotes public outreach, education, accountability, and partnerships.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Forecasting Great Lakes Basin Responses to Future Change',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> USGS scientists are developing science based forecasting tools that capture changes to water flows and discharges of nutrients and sediments to the Great Lakes. The work done by this project provides managers with forecasting tools for predicting the combined effects of climate and land use changes that will help them identify and prioritize the sites best suited for restoration efforts. USGS scientists will use remote-sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors. Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat. Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed ( <em>Phragmites</em>).<br> &nbsp; <h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4> The primary goal is to develop and combine hydrologic models of the Great Lakes Basin suitable for accepting downscaled climate and land-use change inputs, and that produce hydrologic flows suitable for restoration, water quantity, water quality, infrastructure, habitat, and other ecological forecasting. This will facilitate science-based assessments of the impact of climate and land use change on the ecological response at a Great Lakes scale.<br> Specific objectives are as follows:<br> &nbsp; <ul> <li>Build and calibrate a coarse-scale Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model of the Lake Michigan Watershed using data from USGS least-impacted stream gages as calibration targets. Develop model calibration methodologies specifically designed to address the ecological and restoration focus of the models.</li> <li>Evaluate existing evapotranspiration algorithms and develop a new frozen-ground module for the PRMS model.</li> <li>Simulate impacts of climate change on streams in the Lake Michigan Watershed using down-scaled climate-change predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment report.</li> <li>Build one fine-scaled PRMS inset model within the framework of the coarse-scale model to investigate local impacts of climate change in areas of interest to stakeholders.</li> <li>Relate PRMS climate and land-use change flows to SPARROW nutrient loads. Begin work on a TOPMODEL hydrologic flow model of the Great Lakes Basin.</li> <li>Relate historical wildlife disease data to hydrological indices simulated by the watershed models. Use the relation to forecast changes in disease occurrence and distribution that may result from changes in hydrology due to climate and land-use change.</li> </ul> <br> Questions that will be answered to support restoration in the Great Lakes:&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to answer potential questions about the long-term viability of present day restoration investments given the potential for land use and climate change. Such work helps ensure that public and other funds are not directed to restoration projects that have little likelihood of being self-sufficient and viable over societally relevant time scales. This purpose is important in that it is unlikely future funding will be sufficient to support long-term actively managed restoration activities on the Great Lakes scale.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Approach</h4> <strong>Objective 1:</strong>&nbsp;The U.S. Geological Survey Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) will be used as the basis for the climate change hydrologic modeling. The PRMS model uses hydrologic response units (HRUs) to partition the watershed into areas with relatively uniform hydrologic response. As a pilot for the National Hydrologic Model (NHM), we will work with the MoWS group to develop the coarse-scale model using the NHM framework. At its coarsest resolution, the NHM will be made up of HRUs based on reference stream gages (1000+ reference gages within the U.S. identified by David Wolock to be free of anthropogenic effects). Additional real-world geographic locations, such as outlets of reservoirs, confluences of rivers, etc. will be used to help ensure consistency when nesting model applications. For the Lake Michigan model, this will include stream locations with previous estimates of loading to provide a calibration baseline for climate-change predictions using the SPARROW framework, and all of the tributary streams that flow into the lake.<br> <br> The model will be calibrated using the PEST suite of automated calibration software (Doherty, 2010) using a series of least-impacted USGS stream gages as calibration targets. We will also use large-scale datasets of solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration as calibration targets. A step-wise procedure similar to that described in Hay and others (2006) will be used to perform the calibration. The first three steps for calibration (solar radiation, potential ET, annual water balance) will be carried out for the entire model. The final step (monthly water balance, daily flow targets) will be carried out in parts, defined by sub basins in the model. In cases where sub basins are nested, the upstream sub basin will be calibrated first; the parameters in that sub basin will be fixed, and the next downstream sub basin will be calibrated. This procedure will be continued until the confluence with Lake Michigan is reached.<br> <br> <strong>Objective 2:</strong>&nbsp;The current version of PRMS has two algorithms for calculating potential evapotranspiration (PET), which may not provide enough spatial variability across large-scale watersheds. Further, both algorithms rely on temperature and solar radiation as inputs, and it is not clear if the parameters calibrated for a particular climate will apply to an altered climate. We will investigate the two PRMS algorithms along with numerous additional algorithms and determine the best approach to be used for current and future climate conditions. The PRMS model will be modified to use the selected algorithm.<br> <br> The current version of PRMS does not consider frozen ground. This could be simply simulated by adjusting soil-property parameters to reflect the hydrologic response to frozen ground. In reality, frozen ground and the interaction of the surface and subsurface flow paths are much more complicated. A frozen ground module will be developed (Andrew Slater, NSIDC) for incorporation into PRMS using a combination of GLRI and MoWS funds.<br> <br> <strong>Objective 3:</strong>&nbsp;Current efforts for the NHM include developing tools for processing spatial datasets and returning values for selected polygons. There will be several datasets developed with down-scaled climate data culled from the IPCC Fourth Assessment (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). The spatial data processing tool will be used to develop an input data set for PRMS with downscaled climate for each model HRU. The Fourth assessment included results from 15 global climate models (GCMs) run for current conditions and three emissions scenarios. The PRMS model will then be run using the various GCM and emissions scenario combinations, and compared to results for the current climate to determine the impacts of climate change on streamflow in the Lake Michigan watershed. It is anticipated that the coarse-scale model will give representative results at a monthly time scale.<br> <br> <strong>Objective 4:</strong>&nbsp;The first order NHM HRUs will be further discretized into a standalone fine-scale hydrologic model for one area of interest. The area of interest will be selected based on input from stakeholders in the watershed. The PRMS model developed at resolutions finer than the coarse resolution Lake Michigan model will begin by initialization from the set of parameters resulting from calibration in Objective 1. This ensures consistency and quality because the finer resolution model will never have more uncertainty in terms of model misfit compared to the coarse scale model.<br> <br> Anthropogenic factors will be incorporated at the appropriate model resolution. In this manner, the selected higher resolution hydrologic models will be nested within HRUs of coarser resolution hydrologic models. An example of nested scales and model HRUs from the NHM is shown in Figure 2.<br> <br> <strong>Objective 5:</strong>&nbsp;Develop HydroSPARROW, to estimate nutrient concentrations in streams throughout the Great Lakes Basin and loading to the Great Lakes from each tributary in response to the changes in climate and land use. HydroSPARROW will be an extension of the existing SPARROW model to accommodate changing hydrologic flow. This extension will link the existing SPARROW model with several water-quantity models, including the GIS spatially interpolated model used to estimate streamflow used in the SPARROW model (D. Wolock, USGS, person. commun.) and stand-alone models WATER (based on TOPMODEL) and the PRMS model developed as part of this project. The GIS spatially interpolated model estimates streamflow throughout the basin using flow measured at existing USGS gages assuming a similar yield throughout each basin. WATER and PRMS estimate streamflow throughout the basin on the basis of meteorological forcing, and specific topographic and land cover features, which enable the models to incorporate the effects of various land-use and climate-change scenarios. The introduction of hydrologic flows, and changes to flows, will allow estimates of future nutrient loading using SPARROW-calculated.<br> <br> <strong>Objective 6:</strong>&nbsp;A pilot effort to relate USGS National Wildlife Health Center data to simulated historical and future change flows will be conducted. Indices of hydrologic alteration metrics will be compared to historical spatial and temporal changes in wildlife disease in the Lake Michigan Basin. From these initial relations, preliminary forecasts of how land and climate changed flows affect wildlife disease can be made. Depending on the explanatory power of the relation, additional ecological metrics may be included in future work.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Bighead, silver and grass carp larvae were raised in the laboratory. Larvae were observed during the hatching process. Recently hatched larvae were placed in 10 feet tall clear vertical containers where the carp were exposed to light for a similar amount of time during the day as they would experience in a river during the spawning period. Depth selection, swimming behavior, and swimming speed were observed in both day and night periods.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Understanding the stage at which Asian carps begin swimming is critical to development of models that predict whether a river is adequate for reproduction by Asian carps. Knowledge of where and how Asian carp larvae arrive in nursery areas is required to focus efforts on destruction of the larvae and juveniles. Furthermore, knowledge of depth selection and swimming speed are needed to enhance early detection efforts based on egg and larvae detection.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>Bighead and silver carps swam vigorously immediately after hatching, but only vertically. Fish swam vigorously almost straight upwards</li> <li>Horizontal swimming began at a developmental stage coinciding with the development of the gas bladder. At gas bladder inflation, they were capable of holding their position in the water without swimming or vigorous directional swimming.</li> <li>Gas bladder emergence also corresponds to the youngest life stages appearing in off-channel nursery environments, in another USGS study. This indicates that carps choose to move toward nursery habitats, and provides information necessary to deploy control efforts directed at larvae and juvenile carps.</li> <li>Prior to gas bladder inflation, larvae used the entire water column for their upward swimming then sinking behavior. After gas bladder inflation, larvae concentrated near the surface in daylight periods, but spread through the water column at night. This is an indication that surface plankton tows in the daylight period would be most successful for early detection of young Asian carp in nursery habitats.</li> </ul>',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The invasive variety of Phragmites australis (common reed) forms dense stands that can cause negative impacts on coastal Great Lakes wetlands including habitat degradation and reduced biological diversity. Early treatment is key to controlling Phragmites, therefore a map of the current distribution is needed. ALOS PALSAR imagery was used to produce the ﬁrst basin-wide distribution map showing the extent of large, dense invasive Phragmites-dominated habitats in wetlands and other coastal ecosystems along the U.S. shore of the Great Lakes. PALSAR is a satellite imaging radar sensor that is sensitive to differences in plant biomass and inundation patterns, allowing for the detection and delineation of these tall (up to 5 m), high density, high biomass invasive Phragmites stands. Classiﬁcation was based on multi-season ALOS PALSAR L-band (23 cm wavelength) HH and HV polarization data. Seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) datasets were used to improve discrimination of Phragmites by taking advantage of phenological changes in vegetation and inundation patterns over the seasons. Extensive ﬁeld collections of training and randomly selected validation data were conducted in 2010–2011 to aid in mapping and for accuracy assessments. Overall basin-wide map accuracy was 87%, with 86% producer's accuracy and 43% user's accuracy for invasive Phragmites. The invasive Phragmites maps are being used to identify major environmental drivers of this invader's distribution, to assess areas vulnerable to new invasion, and to provide information to regional stakeholders through a decision support tool.\",\n",

Under the assumption that gross trophic transfer efficiency of methylmercury to lake trout from its prey was equal to 80 %, we estimated that the rate at which lake trout eliminated methylmercury was 0.000244 day<sup>−1</sup>. Our laboratory estimate of methylmercury elimination rate was 5.5 times lower than the value predicted by a published regression equation developed from estimates of methylmercury elimination rates for fish available from the literature. Thus, our results, in conjunction with other recent findings, suggested that methylmercury elimination rates for fish have been overestimated in previous studies. In addition, based on our laboratory experiment, we estimated that the net trophic transfer efficiency of inorganic mercury to lake trout from its prey was 63.5 %. The lower net trophic transfer efficiency for inorganic mercury compared with that for methylmercury was partly attributable to the greater elimination rate for inorganic mercury. We also found that the efficiency with which lake trout retained either methylmercury or inorganic mercury from their food did not appear to be significantly affected by the degree of their swimming activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>Recent changes in Lake Michigan’s lower trophic levels were hypothesized to have influenced the diet of omnivorous Mysis diluviana. In this study, the stomach contents of Mysis were examined from juvenile and adults collected monthly (April–October) from a 110-m bottom depth site to describe their seasonal diet in LakeMichigan during 2010. Diatoms were the most common prey item ingested, followed by calanoid copepods, and chrysophytes. Dreissenid veligers were documented in mysid diets for the first time in the Great Lakes, and Cercopagis pengoi were not only consumed but even preferred by adults in summer. Diet proportions by weight were dominated by calanoids, although diets showed a marked shift toward cladocerans in autumn. Juvenile and adult Mysis selected primarily for cladoceran prey but also selected for some calanoid copepod taxa. Comparing available Mysis diet data from 1985 to 2010 indicated generally fewer cladocerans and rotifers per gut and less consistent differences in copepods and Peridinium consumed. The seasonal composition of phyto- and zooplankton prey documented herein should be useful to those seeking to understand the trophic role of Mysis in offshore food webs, but caution should be expressed when generalizing similarities in Mysis diets across other lakes because Lake Michigan’s population seems relatively more herbivorous.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> USGS researchers have determined the densities of the eggs as these develop, and how much time the bighead and silver carp require to begin swimming and migrating laterally from flowing water into nursery habitat. This information about egg transport requirements was used to create a Tributary Assessment Tool also referred to as the Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg) model. The development of this tool was a collaborative effort between USGS and the University of Illinois. The tool takes into account the hydraulics of a river (water velocity and dispersion rates) and the water temperature (affects egg and larvae development rates) in order to determine if a river is sufficiently long and the velocities high enough for the eggs to be kept in suspension to develop into larvae.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The biological and Asian carp life history research conducted by USGS has made significant contributions to understanding the development of bighead, silver and grass carp as well as how the development rate changes with water temperature. The resulting publications and datasets will help the entire scientific community in the study of Asian carp.<br> The hydraulic and water-quality data collected on Great Lakes tributaries along with information about potential spawning locations and egg settling zones in reaches along the rivers help managers target locations and control measures in rivers where eggs may settle or Asian carp may spawn. The hydraulic data analysis from this project may also lead to control strategies such as determining placement of low-head dams to create settling zones that disrupt egg development but cause fewer ecological impacts than other control strategies such as poisons.<br> The Tributary Assessment Tool developed in this project can be used by managers to efficiently identify Great Lakes tributaries that pose elevated risk for reproduction of bighead and silver carp by using hydraulic characteristics to simulate egg travel times and likelihood of eggs staying in suspension until development.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>Asian carp can successfully spawn in rivers as short as 16 miles as opposed to the 62 mile length previously assumed to be the minimum.</li> <li>Asian carp eggs can stay suspended in rivers with velocities as low as 15-25 centimeters/second.</li> <li>Many more Great Lakes tributaries would be at risk of having Asian carp spawning and recruitment with the new understanding of the river length and flow requirements.</li> <li>o FluEgg outputs provide valuable insights into egg suspension and settlement by predicting the drifting behavior of the eggs based on river characteristics.</li> </ul> <h4>Products</h4> Garcia, Tatiana; Murphy, Elizabeth A.; Jackson, P.

       "  'abstract': 'In 1972, the US and Canada committed to restore the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes Ecosystem under the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. During subsequent amendments, part of the St. Lawrence River at Massena NY, and segments of three tributaries, were designated as one Area of Concern (AOC) due to various beneficial use impairments (BUIs). Plankton beneficial use was designated impaired within this AOC because phytoplankton and zooplankton population data were unavailable or needed “further assessment”. Contaminated sediments from industrial waste disposal have been largely remediated, thus, the plankton BUI may currently be obsolete. The St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC remedial action plan established two criteria which may be used to assess the plankton BUI; the second states that, “in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters”. This study was implemented during 2011 to determine whether this criterion was achieved. Acute toxicity and chronic toxicity of local waters were quantified seasonally using standardized bioassays with green alga <i>Selenastrum capricornutum</i> and water flea <i>Ceriodaphnia dubia</i> to test the hypothesis that waters from sites within the AOC were no more toxic than were waters from adjacent reference sites. The results of univariate and multivariate analyses confirm that ambient waters from most AOC sites (and seasons) were not toxic to both species. Assuming both test species represent natural plankton assemblages, the quality of surface waters throughout most of this AOC should not seriously impair the health of resident plankton communities.',\n",

Evidence from optical indices suggests that DOM in these habitats generally ranged from allochthonous (R sites) to a mix of allochthonous-like and autochthonous-like (L sites). Contrary to expectations, DOM properties such as the fluorescence index, humification index, and spectral slope ratio were only weakly related to land cover or nutrient data (Bayesian&nbsp;</span><i>R</i><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;values were indistinguishable from zero). Strongly supported models in all habitat types linked DOM quantity (that is, dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC]) to both land cover and nutrients (Bayesian&nbsp;</span><i>R</i><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;values ranging from 0.55 to 0.72). Strongly supported models predicting DOC changed with habitat type: The most important predictor in R sites was wetlands whereas the most important predictor at L sites was croplands. These results suggest that as the DOM pool becomes more autochthonous-like, croplands become a more important driver of spatial variation in DOC and wetlands become less important.</span></p>',\n",

These results provide information identified as critical by land managers and regulators to assess the ‘Bird or Animal Deformity or Reproductive Problems’ Beneficial Use Impairment. Eggs were collected from 69 sites across all five Great Lakes, including 27 Areas of Concern (AOCs), some with multiple sites, and ten sites not listed as an AOC. Concentrations of organic contaminants in eggs were quantified and compared to background and reproductive effect thresholds. Approximately one-third of the AOCs had geometric mean concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at or below background exposure (0.34 \\uf06dg/g wet wt.). Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was minimal, and only three of 27 AOCs and 1 non-AOC had geometric mean concentrations that exceeded background for tree swallows (96 ng/g wet wt.). Concentrations of both PCBs and PBDEs were 10 – 20 times below the lower limit for hatching effects. In contrast, geometric mean concentrations of dioxin and furan toxic equivalents (TEQs) at Saginaw River and Bay AOC and Midland, MI, a non-AOC site, exceeded the lower limit for hatching effects (181 pg/g dioxin/furan TEQs). The rest of the sites, except for Cuyahoga River, OH, had geometric mean concentrations of dioxin and furan TEQs below background levels (87 pg/g dioxin/furan TEQs).

Soft water has been said to cause the bursting of Asian carp eggs and thus has been suggested as a factor that would limit the spread of this species. To evaluate this, we subjected fertilized eggs of bighead carp to waters with a wide range of hardness and dissolved-solid concentrations. Hatching rate and egg size were not significantly affected by the different water qualities. These results, combined with the low hardness (28–84 mg/L) of the Yangtze River (the primary natal habitat of Hypophthalmichthys spp.), suggest that managers and those performing risk assessments for the establishment of Hypophthalmichthys spp. should be cautious about treating low hardness and dissolved-solid concentrations as limiting factors.',\n",

For the Laurentian Great Lakes, where, since the early 1970s, nutrient inputs have been reduced, whereas top-predator biomass has increased, we describe trends across multiple trophic levels and explore their underlying drivers. Our analyses revealed increasing water clarity and declines in phytoplankton, native invertebrates, and prey fish since 1998 in at least three of the five lakes. Evidence for bottom-up regulation was strongest in Lake Huron, although each lake provided support in at least one pair of trophic levels. Evidence for top-down regulation was rare. Although nonindigenous dreissenid mussels probably have large impacts on nutrient cycling and phytoplankton, their effects on higher trophic levels remain uncertain. We highlight gaps for which monitoring and knowledge should improve the understanding of food-web dynamics and facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The field portion of a method validation study was completed August 2015. The study was designed to test the accuracy of a LAMP method to detect eDNA of Asian carps during simulated fish transport. During the study, more than 10,000 minnows were held in each of three fish transport tanks. Ten 4-inch silver carp were placed in one tank, a single 4-inch silver carp in the second tank while the third tank had no silver carp and served as a negative control. The LAMP method used amplifies the DNA of both bighead carp and silver carp. Three replicate trials were completed on separate days with side-by-side analyses completed by three novice and two expert users. Expert users had extensive experience completing laboratory-based genetic and molecular methods whereas novice users included two conservation officers and a geospatial studies student, all with minimal to no genetics or molecular experience. Water samples were tested from tanks at multiple time points to determine how long a silver carp needs to be present before it can be detected. Additional samples are being processed to compare the LAMP method and laboratory-based Asian carp eDNA methods and to determine the optimal number of replicates for the LAMP method to maximize detection of Asian carp eDNA.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> If successful, the LAMP method will allow end users to take the power of eDNA amplification and detection from the laboratory to the field, significantly decreasing the time to obtain results and thus enhancing the utility of this powerful tool. By simplifying sample collection, preparation and analysis, the LAMP method and supporting amplification system may allow even novice users with only minimal training and without expertise in a genetics or molecular laboratory to collect and analyze eDNA samples in less than one hour. These key advantages could provide a critical tool to provide managers with the critical and timely information needed to make time-sensitive decisions to help prevent the spread of invasive species or pathogens.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Coming soon - data analyses are in progress.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> <ul> <li>Oral presentation \\\\\"A New Tool to Rapidly Detect Invasive Species in Transport as Bait,\\\\\" 2015 Fall Great Lakes Law Enforcement Committee meeting; Windsor, Ontario, Canada.</li> <li>Upcoming: Manuscript on the new technology to be published in 2016</li> <li>A peer-reviewed publication will be prepared when data analyses are completed.</li> </ul> <br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"At public beaches, it is now common to mitigate the impact of water-borne pathogens by posting a swimmer's advisory when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exceeds an action threshold. Since culturing the bacteria delays public notification when dangerous conditions exist, regression models are sometimes used to predict the FIB concentration based on readily-available environmental measurements. It is hard to know which environmental parameters are relevant to predicting FIB concentration, and the parameters are usually correlated, which can hurt the predictive power of a regression model. Here the method of partial least squares (PLS) is introduced to automate the regression modeling process. Model selection is reduced to the process of setting a tuning parameter to control the decision threshold that separates predicted exceedances of the standard from predicted non-exceedances. The method is validated by application to four Great Lakes beaches during the summer of 2010. Performance of the PLS models compares favorably to that of the existing state-of-the-art regression models at these four sites.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Jeorse Park Beach is located in East Chicago, Indiana, within the Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AOC), which has been identified as having all 14 beneficial use designations impaired, including beach closings. Jeorse Park Beach has been identified as one of the most highly contaminated beaches in the nation, with annual beach closings due to bacterial contamination as high as 76% in 2010. Further, beach closings have steadily increased each year since beach monitoring was initiated in 2005 in response to the Beaches Environmental and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act. Beach closings represent an environmental, social, and economic burden, the alleviation of which require various remediation strategies targeted to specific sources of microbiological contamination. Research by USGS at Jeorse Park Beach in cooperation with the State of Indiana has identified dual factors contributing to beach closings: (1) the enclosed circulation of the beach area prevents contaminants from moving out of the embayment and (2) resident shore birds (geese, gulls) are a significant source of fecal contamination to the swimming water. In addition to bird contamination, evidence of human sewage contamination has also been found at this beach. The presence of additional sources of contamination, originating within or outside of the beach, and the influence of beach circulation patterns on retaining and influencing the persistence of these bacteria remain unknown. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deepwater sculpins (<i>Myoxocephalus thompsonii</i>) are an important link in deepwater benthic foodwebs of the Great Lakes. Little information exists about deepwater sculpin spawning habits and early life history ecology due to difficulty in sampling deep offshore habitats. Larval and age-0 deepwater sculpins collected in northern Lake Huron and the Detroit River during 2007 were used to improve our understanding of their habitat use, diet, age, and growth. Peak larval density reached 8.4/1000 m<sup>3</sup> in the Detroit River during April and was higher than that in Lake Huron. Offshore bottom trawls at DeTour and Hammond Bay first collected benthic age-0 deepwater sculpins in early September when fish were ≥ 25 mm TL. Otolith analysis revealed that hatch dates for pelagic larvae occurred during late March and larvae remained pelagic for 40 to 60 days. Diet of pelagic larvae (10–21 mm TL) was dominated by calanoid copepods at all sample locations. Diets of benthic age-0 fish varied by location and depth: Mysis and chironomids were prevalent in fish from Hammond Bay and the 91 m site at DeTour, but only chironomids were found in fish from the 37 m DeTour site. This work showed that nearshore epilimnetic sites were important for pelagic larvae and an ontogenetic shift from pelagic planktivore to benthivore occurred at about 25 mm TL in late summer. Age analysis showed that larvae remained pelagic long enough to be transported through the St. Clair–Detroit River system, Lake Erie, and the Niagara River, potentially contributing to populations in Lake Ontario.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'At the interface of the Great Lakes and their tributary rivers lies the rivermouths, a class of aquatic ecosystem where lake and lotic processes mix and distinct features emerge. Many rivermouths are the focal point of both human interaction with the Great Lakes and human impacts to the lakes; many cities, ports, and beaches are located in rivermouth ecosystems, and these human pressures often degrade key ecological functions that rivermouths provide. Despite their ecological uniqueness and apparent economic importance, there has been relatively little research on these ecosystems as a class relative to studies on upstream rivers or the open-lake waters. Here we present a synthesis of current knowledge about ecosystem structure and function in Great Lakes rivermouths based on studies in both Laurentian rivermouths, coastal wetlands, and marine estuarine systems. A conceptual model is presented that establishes a common semantic framework for discussing the characteristic spatial features of rivermouths. This model then is used to conceptually link ecosystem structure and function to ecological services provided by rivermouths. This synthesis helps identify the critical gaps in understanding rivermouth ecology. Specifically, additional information is needed on how rivermouths collectively influence the Great Lakes ecosystem, how human alterations influence rivermouth functions, and how ecosystem services provided by rivermouths can be managed to benefit the surrounding socioeconomic networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled “Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan”. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of bathymetric soundings in coastal Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana. Water column depths were measured using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz Rio Grande acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted to a U.S. Geological Survey hydrographic survey vessel. The water column depths from the four diverging beams of the ADCP have been corrected for instrument heading, pitch, and roll and georectified using The Velocity Mapping Toolbox (https://hydroacoustics.usgs.gov/movingboat/VMT/VMT.shtml). Geolocation of the beam soundings was possible using a Hemisphere Crescent A100 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted directly above the ADCP. This GPS receiver has sub-meter horizontal accuracy when operated in differential mode. The edited water column depths were transformed to lake bed elevations using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Calumet Harbor Water Level Gage (9087044) which records at 6-minute intervals. This gage is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the survey site. Bed elevations have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a foot.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Molecular responses differ between sensitive silver carp and tolerant bighead carp and bigmouth buffalo exposed to rotenone',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Some species of fish are more tolerant of rotenone, a commonly used non-specific piscicide, than others. This species-specific tolerance to rotenone has been thought to be associated with the uptake and the efficiency at which the chemical is detoxified. However, rotenone stimulates oxidative stress and superoxides, which are also toxic. Understanding the modes in which fish physiologically respond to rotenone is important in developing improved protocols for its application in controlling aquatic nuisance species. Using a molecular approach, we investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms of rotenone resistance. Species-specific responses were observed when rotenone-sensitive silver, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and both rotenone-resistant bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and bigmouth buffalo, Ictiobus cyprinellus, were exposed to rotenone. Rotenone levels in plasma were highest 90 min after exposure in both silver carp and bigmouth buffalo, but bigmouth buffalo tolerated over twice the burden (ng mL<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) than silver carp. Expression of genes related with detoxification (<i>cyp1a</i> and <i>gst</i>) increased in silver carp, but either decreased or remained the same in bighead carp. Genes linked with oxidative stress in the cytosol (<i>gpx</i>, <i>cat</i> and <i>sod1</i>) and <i>hsp70</i> increased only in silver carp after a 6-h exposure. Expression of genes associated with oxidative stress in the mitochondria (<i>sod2</i> and <i>ucp2</i>) differed between silver carp and bighead carp. Expression of <i>sod2</i> changed minimally in bighead carp, but expression of <i>ucp2</i> linearly increased to nearly 85-fold of the level prior to exposure. Expression of <i>sod2</i> and <i>ucp2</i> did not change until 6 h in silver carp. Use of <i>sod1</i> and <i>sod2</i> to combat oxidative stress results in hydrogen peroxide production, while use of <i>ucp2</i> produces nitric oxide, a chemical known to inhibit apoptosis. We conclude that the mechanism at which a fish handles oxidative stress plays an important role in the tolerance to rotenone.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Exploring nearshore-offshore linkages in energy transfer within Great Lakes food webs: implications for fish production in Lake Michigan in support of CSMI 2015',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Since the early 2000s, the LaMP has proposed adding nutrients (specifically phosphorus) to its “pollutant of concern” list, given that excessive nutrients were believed to cause impairments in the nearshore waters. Since that time, scientists have highlighted the “shunting” of nutrients to the nearshore, owing to the ability of invasive dreissenid mussels to capture some portion of allochthanous phosphorus that enters the lake through tributaries. These changes are believed to underlie a series of changes in the nearshore, including increased biomass of cladophora and hypothesized increases in benthic and pelagic biomass, including zooplankton and fish. As an extension, this model proposes the offshore is receiving fewer nutrients than in previous decades, when 1) phosphorus inputs were higher and 2) dreissenid mussels were not present to sequester the phosphorus. Understanding the distribution and abundance of nutrients and biota (e.g., invertebrates, fish) across a nearshore to offshore gradient remains a key knowledge gap identified by the Lake Michigan LAMP and fishery management community. Increased understanding and knowledge of the Lake Michigan nearshore will facilitate the development of a Nearshore Strategy by the LAMP, which is called for in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. <br /> <br /> This project seeks to improve understanding of the food-web linkages between nearshore and offshore with a design that samples eight nearshore-to-offshore transects, with water, plankton, benthos, and fish being sampled at 18, 46, and &gt;100 m bottom depth at each transect. This design builds on sampling only 2 transects (but with greater temporal frequency) in coordination with the 2010 CSMI year. Results from that work indicated that the nearshore zone was not necessarily more productive than deeper waters, opposite from conventional knowledge of Great Lakes ecosystems. Hence the 2015 sampling design has been modified to emphasize broader spatial coverage. Furthermore, the 2015 design locates transects along a gradient of proximity to tributary inputs of phosphorus (from adjacent to high-loading tributaries, such as the St. Joseph River, to adjacent to no tributaries, such as offshore of Arcadia, Michigan). Sampling of transects will occur in spring, summer, and autumn, and we are coordinating with other agencies to describe patterns in areas shallower or deeper than our sampling design. We also would welcome collaboration with others to add sampling transects in the northern basin of the lake. Key questions being addressed include 1) How does nutrient availability change from nearshore to offshore and how is that availability influenced by proximity to tributary inputs?, 2) How well does productivity of phytoplankton within a given habitat correspond to productivity of zooplankton and fish?, 3) Does the physiological condition of prey fish change from nearshore to offshore or with proximity to tributary inputs?, 4) What is the biomass of fish predicted from size spectrum modeling and how does this compare to other Great Lakes? <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>Relationships between large-scale environmental factors and the incidence of type E avian botulism outbreaks in Lake Michigan were examined from 1963 to 2008. Avian botulism outbreaks most frequently occurred in years with low mean annual water levels, and lake levels were significantly lower in outbreak years than in non-outbreak years. Mean surface water temperatures in northern Lake Michigan during the period when type E outbreaks tend to occur (July through September) were significantly higher in outbreak years than in non-outbreak years. Trends in fish populations did not strongly correlate with botulism outbreaks, although botulism outbreaks in the 1960s coincided with high alewife abundance, and recent botulism outbreaks coincided with rapidly increasing round goby abundance. Botulism outbreaks occurred cyclically, and the frequency of outbreaks did not increase over the period of record. Climate change scenarios for the Great Lakes predict lower water levels and warmer water temperatures. As a consequence, the frequency and magnitude of type E botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes may increase.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Models of environmental systems have become increasingly complex, incorporating increasingly large numbers of parameters in an effort to represent physical processes on a scale approaching that at which they occur in nature. Consequently, the inverse problem of parameter estimation (specifically, model calibration) and subsequent uncertainty analysis have become increasingly computation-intensive endeavors. Fortunately, advances in computing have made computational power equivalent to that of dozens to hundreds of desktop computers accessible through a variety of alternate means: modelers have various possibilities, ranging from traditional Local Area Networks (LANs) to cloud computing. Commonly used parameter estimation software is well suited to take advantage of the availability of such increased computing power. Unfortunately, logistical issues become increasingly important as an increasing number and variety of computers are brought to bear on the inverse problem. To facilitate efficient access to disparate computer resources, the PESTCommander program documented herein has been developed to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that facilitates the management of model files (\\\\\"file management\\\\\") and remote launching and termination of \\\\\"slave\\\\\" computers across a distributed network of computers (\\\\\"run management\\\\\"). In version 1.0 described here, PESTCommander can access and ascertain resources across traditional Windows LANs: however, the architecture of PESTCommander has been developed with the intent that future releases will be able to access computing resources (1) via trusted domains established in Wide Area Networks (WANs) in multiple remote locations and (2) via heterogeneous networks of Windows- and Unix-based operating systems. The design of PESTCommander also makes it suitable for extension to other computational resources, such as those that are available via cloud computing. Version 1.0 of PESTCommander was developed primarily to work with the parameter estimation software PEST; the discussion presented in this report focuses on the use of the PESTCommander together with Parallel PEST. However, PESTCommander can be used with a wide variety of programs and models that require management, distribution, and cleanup of files before or after model execution. In addition to its use with the Parallel PEST program suite, discussion is also included in this report regarding the use of PESTCommander with the Global Run Manager GENIE, which was developed simultaneously with PESTCommander.',\n",

It would be advantageous and cost-effective, especially for studies conducted on a regional scale, to use a method that can simultaneously filter and concentrate all classes of pathogens from the large volumes of water needed to detect pathogens. In seven recovery experiments, stock cultures of viruses and protozoa were seeded into 10-liter lake water samples, and concentrations of naturally occurring bacterial indicators were used to determine recoveries. For the five filtration methods tested, the highest median recoveries were as follows: glass wool for adenovirus (4.7%); NanoCeram for enterovirus (14.5%) and MS2 coliphage (84%); continuous-flow centrifugation (CFC) plus Virocap (CFC+ViroCap) for <i>Escherichia coli</i> (68.3%) and <i>Cryptosporidium</i> (54%); automatic ultrafiltration (UF) for norovirus GII (2.4%); and dead-end UF for <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (80.5%), avian influenza virus (0.02%), and <i>Giardia</i> (57%). In evaluating filter performance in terms of both recovery and variability, the automatic UF resulted in the highest recovery while maintaining low variability for all nine microorganisms.

       "  'abstract': 'As bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix (the bigheaded carps) are poised to enter the Laurentian Great Lakes and potentially damage the region’s economically important fishery, information on developmental rates and behaviors of carps is critical to assessing their ability to establish sustainable populations within the Great Lakes basin. In laboratory experiments, the embryonic and larval developmental rates, size, and behaviors of bigheaded carp were tracked at two temperature treatments, one “cold” and one “warm”. Developmental rates were computed using previously described stages of development and the cumulative thermal unit method. Both species have similar thermal requirements, with a minimum developmental temperature for embryonic stages of 12.1° C for silver carp and 12.9° C for bighead carp, and 13.3° C for silver carp larval stages and 13.4° C for bighead carp larval stages. Egg size differed among species and temperature treatments, as egg size was larger in bighead carp, and “warm\\\\\" temperature treatments. The larvae started robust upwards vertical swimming immediately after hatching, interspersed with intervals of sinking. Vertical swimming tubes were used to measure water column distribution, and ascent and descent rates of vertically swimming fish. Water column distribution and ascent and descent rates changed with ontogeny. Water column distribution also showed some diel periodicity. Developmental rates, size, and behaviors contribute to the drift distance needed to fulfill the early life history requirements of bigheaded carps and can be used in conjunction with transport information to assess invasibility of a river.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Enterococci are common, commensal members of gut communities in mammals and birds, yet they are also opportunistic pathogens that cause millions of human and animal infections annually. Because they are shed in human and animal feces, are readily culturable, and predict human health risks from exposure to polluted recreational waters, they are used as surrogates for waterborne pathogens and as fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in research and in water quality testing throughout the world. Evidence from several decades of research demonstrates, however, that enterococci may be present in high densities in the absence of obvious fecal sources and that environmental reservoirs of these FIB are important sources and sinks, with the potential to impact water quality. This review focuses on the distribution and microbial ecology of enterococci in environmental (secondary) habitats, including the effect of environmental stressors; an outline of their known and apparent sources, sinks, and fluxes; and an overview of the use of enterococci as FIB. Finally, the significance of emerging methodologies, such as microbial source tracking (MST) and empirical predictive models, as tools in water quality monitoring is addressed. The mounting evidence for widespread extraenteric sources and reservoirs of enterococci demonstrates the versatility of the genus Enterococcus and argues for the necessity of a better understanding of their ecology in natural environments, as well as their roles as opportunistic pathogens and indicators of human pathogens.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected in support of a multi-agency effort to evaluate the feasibility of using carbon dioxide to create a barrier and prevent upstream passage of invasive fish through navigational locks. The auxiliary lock at Lock and Dam 14 on the Mississippi River near Pleasant Valley, Iowa, was chosen for a field-scale trial of the carbon dioxide barrier to be conducted in 2018. In preparation for this trial, the mixing in the lock chamber during routine operations and the fate and transport of lock water released to the pool downstream was studied using a dye tracer. In June 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) performed two injections of Rhodamine WT dye into the auxiliary lock chamber as the lock was filled. The dye was injected directly into the fill water at the upstream valves on both sides of the lock. The first injection of 0.82 liters of Rhodamine WT (0.41 liters per intake) occurred at 9:50 am on June 13, 2017. The second injection of 0.25 liters of Rhodamine WT (0.125 liters per intake) occurred at 12:11 pm on June 13, 2017. Both injections started approximately 1 minute after filling of the lock began and the injections took approximately 2 minutes to complete. The total time to fill the auxiliary lock in both cases was 6 minutes. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT). The distribution of dye within the lock chamber and downstream of the lock was measured using eight Turner Designs C3 submersible fluorometers (1 in vertical profiling mode in the lock chamber, 6 at fixed locations downstream of the lock, and 1 mounted on a mobile survey vessel).<br> This data release is comprised of three-dimensional point measurements of dye concentration within the auxiliary lock chamber, time series of dye concentration at a six fixed locations downstream of the auxiliary lock chamber, and time series of dye concentration measured by a mobile survey vessel that mapped the dye plume downstream of the auxiliary lock chamber at Lock and Dam 14 on the Mississippi River near Pleasant Valley, Iowa, on June 13, 2017 and June 14, 2017. In addition, the data release includes a time series of water surface elevation within the auxiliary lock chamber at Lock and Dam 14 between June 12, 2017 and June 14, 2017.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is the largest public investment in the Great Lakes in two decades. A task force of 11 Federal agencies developed an action plan to implement the initiative. The U.S. Department of the Interior was one of the 11 agencies that entered into an interagency agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of the GLRI to complete scientific projects throughout the Great Lakes basin. The U.S. Geological Survey, a bureau within the Department of the Interior, is involved in the GLRI to provide scientific support to management decisions as well as measure progress of the Great Lakes basin restoration efforts. This report presents basin-scale simulated current and forecast climatic and hydrologic conditions in the Lake Michigan Basin. The forecasts were obtained by constructing and calibrating a Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model of the Lake Michigan Basin; the PRMS model was calibrated using the parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis (PEST) software suite. The calibrated model was used to evaluate potential responses to climate change by using four simulated carbon emission scenarios from eight general circulation models released by the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase&nbsp;3. Statistically downscaled datasets of these scenarios were used to project hydrologic response for the Lake Michigan Basin. In general, most of the observation sites in the Lake Michigan Basin indicated slight increases in annual streamflow in response to future climate change scenarios. Monthly streamflows indicated a general shift from the current (2014) winter-storage/snowmelt-pulse system to a system with a more equally distributed hydrograph throughout the year. Simulated soil moisture within the basin illustrates that conditions within the basin are also expected to change on a monthly timescale. One effect of increasing air temperature as a result of the changing climate was the appreciable increase in the length of the growing season in the Lake Michigan Basin. The increase in growing season will cause an increase in evapotranspiration across the Lake Michigan Basin, which will directly affect soil moisture and late growing season streamflows. Output from the Lake Michigan Basin PRMS model is available through an online dynamic web mapping service available at (http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5175/). The map service includes layers for the each of the 8 global climate models and 4 carbon emission scenarios combinations for 12 hydrologic model state variables. The layers are pre-rendered maps of annual hydrologic response from 1977 through 2099 that provide an easily accessible online method to examine climate change effects across the Lake Michigan Basin.</p>',\n",

The numerical model was based on the transport of E. coli by current circulation patterns in the embayment driven by longshore main currents and the loss of <i>E. coli</i> in the water column, taking settling as well as bacterial dark- and solar-related decay into account. Two <i>E. coli</i> loading scenarios were considered: one from the open boundary north of the embayment and the other from the shallow water near the beachfront. Simulations showed that the embayed beach behaves as a sink for <i>E. coli</i> in that it generally receives E. coli more efficiently than it releases them. This is a result of the significantly different hydrodynamic forcing factors between the inside of the embayment and the main coastal flow outside. The settled <i>E. coli</i> inside the embayment can be a potential source of contamination during subsequent sediment resuspension events, suggesting that deposition-resuspension cycles of <i>E. coli</i> have resulted in excessive bacterial contamination of beach water. A further hypothetical case with a breakwater shortened to half its original length, which was anticipated to enhance the current circulation in the embayment, showed a reduction in <i>E. coli</i> concentrations of nearly 20%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the recent release of new recreational water quality monitoring criteria, there are more options for regulatory agencies seeking to protect beachgoers from waterborne pathogens. Included are methods that can reduce analytical time, providing timelier estimates of water quality, but the application of these methods has not been examined at most beaches for expectation of health risk and management decisions. In this analysis, we explore health and monitoring outcomes expected at Lake Michigan beaches using protocols for indicator bacteria including culturable Escherichia coli (E. coli; EC), culturable enterococci (ENT), and enterococci as analyzed by qPCR (QENT). Correlations between method results were generally high, except at beaches with historically high concentrations of EC. The “beach action value” was exceeded most often when using EC or ENT as the target indicator; QENT exceeded the limit far less frequently. Measured water quality between years was varied. Although methods with equivalent health expectation have been established, the lack of relationship among method outcomes and annual changes in mean indicator bacteria concentrations complicates the decision-making process. The monitoring approach selected by beach managers may be a combination of available tools that maximizes timely health protection, cost efficiency, and collaboration among beach jurisdictions.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Lake sturgeon response to a spawning reef constructed in the Detroit river',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Prior to the First World War, the bi-national Detroit River provided vast areas of functional fish spawning and nursery habitat. However, ongoing conflicting human uses of these waters for activities such as waste disposal, water withdrawals, shoreline development, shipping, recreation, and fishing have altered many of the chemical, physical, and biological processes of the Detroit River. Of particular interest and concern to resource managers and stakeholders is the significant loss and impairment of fish spawning and nursery habitat that led to the decline in abundance of most fish species using this ecosystem. Lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>) populations for example, were nearly extirpated by the middle of the 20th century, leaving only a small fraction of their former population. Fisheries managers recognized that the loss of suitable fish spawning habitat is a limiting factor in lake sturgeon population rehabilitation in the Detroit River. In efforts to remediate this beneficial water use impairment, a reef consisting of a mixture of natural rock and limestone was constructed at the upstream end of Fighting Island in 2008. This paper focuses on the response by lake sturgeon to the different replicates of suitable natural materials used to construct the fish spawning habitat at Fighting Island in the Detroit River. Pre-construction fisheries assessment during 2006–2008 showed that along with the presence of adult lake sturgeon, spawning conditions were favorable. However, no eggs were found in assessments conducted prior to reef construction. The 3300 m<sup>2</sup> Fighting Island reef was placed at the upstream end of the island in October of 2008. The construction design included 12 spawning beds of three replicates each consisting of either round rock, small or large (shot-rock) diameter limestone or a mixture thereof. An observed response by spawning lake sturgeon occurred the following year when spawning-ready adults (ripe), viable eggs, and larvae were collected during May and June 2009. Additional eggs and spawning-ready adults were found in 2010 (no larval sampling occurred in 2010) as well as collection of three age-0 juvenile lake sturgeon in bottom trawls fished downstream of the reef during July 2010. Spawning lake sturgeon showed no repeatable preference for any of the four particular substrate types but showed a high degree of preference for the island side of the channel, where faster water current velocities occurred. In 2009, overall lake sturgeon egg densities across all replicates averaged 102 m<sup>-2</sup> and seven larvae were found in night drift-net samples. In 2010, average lake sturgeon egg density was 12 m<sup>-2</sup> and three age-0 lake sturgeon averaging 120 mm TL were collected in bottom trawls in deepwater (∼8 m depth) downstream from the constructed reef. These results demonstrated successful reproduction by lake sturgeon on a man-made reef and suggested that additions and improvements to fish spawning habitat could enhance reproduction and early life history survival of lake sturgeon in the Detroit River.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'There is an immediate need for effective and safe tools to prevent the spread of planktonic larval dreissenids (quagga <em>Dreissena rostriformis</em> bugensis and zebra mussels <em>D. polymorpha</em>) and to rehabilitate and protect native unionid habitats by controlling existing dreissenid mussel populations in and around the Great Lakes. <a href=\\\\\"http://www.fws.gov/midwest/mussel/threatened.html\\\\\">More than half of the 78 native unionid species in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio are listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern</a>. Although the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) considers zebra mussels to be an <a href=\\\\\"http://www.fws.gov/midwest/mussel/current_threats.html\\\\\">immediate threat</a> to freshwater unionids in the Upper Mississippi River System, there is no effective tool to control established zebra mussel infestations in native unionid mussel beds. Not only do quagga and zebra mussels harm native mussels, they also disrupt the entire aquatic food change with potentially devastating effects to multiple fish species, including sport fish.<br> <br> Ecologists at the <a href=\\\\\"http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/research_collections/research/labs/fieldlab/index.html\\\\\">New York State Museum Field Research Laboratory</a>(NYSM) discovered a strain of the common soil bacterium <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> ( <em>Pf</em>-CL145A) originally isolated from river sediments in North America that had selective activity against zebra mussels. Early in this process, NYSM scientists discovered that killed cells of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A had similarly activity as live <em>Pf-</em>CL145A cells against dreissenid mussels, thus all future studies and development will be completed using killed cells of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A. When ingested by filter-feeding zebra and quagga mussels, a cellular component of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A targets the digestive gland of dreissenid mussels , ultimately resulting in their death. As part of the development of the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A killed-cell product at NYSM, a series of non-target laboratory and mesocosm trials were conducted to assess its specificity to zebra and quagga mussels. These acute toxicity trials included a variety of aquatic organisms, including a freshwater ciliate <em>Colpidium colpoda</em>, zooplankton <em>Daphnia magna</em>, freshwater amphipod <em>Hyalella azteca</em>, bluegill <em>Lepomis macrochirus</em>, fathead minnow <em>Pimephales promelas</em>, brown trout <em>Salmo trutta</em>, blue mussels <em>Mytilus edulis</em> and adult unionids Eastern elliptio <em>Elliptio complanata</em>, Eastern lampmussel <em>Lampsilis radiata</em>, creek heelsplitter <em>Lasmigona compressa</em>, giant floater <em>Pyganodon grandis</em>, creeper <em>Strophitus undulates</em>, Eastern floater <em>Pyganodon cataracta</em>. Significant mortality in these non-target organisms did not occur even when exposed to levels of the Pf-CL145A killed-cell product that was lethal to zebra mussels (i.e., exposed animal mortality did not differ from that of untreated controls).<br> <br> The <em>Pf</em>-CL145A killed-cell product is currently being developed as the commercial product <a href=\\\\\"http://marronebioinnovations.com/products/zequanox/\\\\\">Zequanox™</a> by Marrone Bio Innovations (MBI; Davis, CA). It was registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 29, 2011 to control dreissenid mussels in defined discharges. Studies, including those to assess potential human health risks, were completed by MBI and reviewed by EPA as part of the registration process. Living cells of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A (technically the active ingredient) applied to rats through the skin (dermal), in feed (oral), and by inhalation caused no adverse effect and were non-pathogenic to rats. One measure of toxicity, the oral LD50 (the dose expected to be lethal to 50% of the exposed population) had a value of &gt;5000 mg/kg, placing <em>Pf</em>-CL145A in the lowest risk category for pesticide products. The EPA concluded from the available information that Zequanox™ to be <a href=\\\\\"http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/stprf.htm#some\\\\\">“tolerance exempt ”</a>, one of the highest safety levels assigned by EPA to pesticide products.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Description of Work</h4> This project, funded through a competitive grant award from the <a href=\\\\\"http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/glri/\\\\\">EPA\\'s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative</a> and through appropriated funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is a collaborative effort between the NYSM, the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) and the USFWS <a href=\\\\\"http://www.fws.gov/midwest/genoa/\\\\\">Genoa National Fish Hatchery</a> (GNFH). The project is independent of MBI in all aspects other than providing Zequanox™ for experimental use and does not receive funding from any non-profit organizations or state natural resource agencies. Though <em>Pf</em>-CL145A has proven effective in experiments designed to evaluate its use to control dreissenid mussels in pipes, little research has been conducted to evaluate its potential for controlling existing dreissenid mussel populations in open waters or to prevent the distribution of dreissenid mussel veligers in transported water (i.e., the water in a fish hatchery distribution truck). Comprehensive research is required to determine the potential of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A as a dreissenid management tool for natural aquatic habitats. Determining this potential may ultimately allow this emerging technology to be used to support ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation efforts in and around the Great Lakes. The three objectives of this project are to:<br> &nbsp; <ul> <li>Evaluate the acute toxicity of the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A commercial product formulations on freshwater fish and unionids from the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.</li> <li>Prevent the spread of dreissenids by developing and demonstrating treatment protocols to use the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A-based product to kill 100% of the planktonic larvae (veligers) in contained systems such as fish transport water and within fish hatcheries.</li> <li>Develop application methods for using <em>Pf</em>-CL145A to reduce dreissenid populations within native unionid restoration structures and within native unionid beds. Assess implementation of potential integrated pest management strategies that incorporate the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A-based product as an aid in native unionid restoration.</li> </ul> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/zm_veligers.gif\\\\\"><br> <u>Video courtesy of New York State Museum.</u><br> &nbsp; <h4>Approach</h4> <strong>Objective 1</strong>: Evaluate the acute toxicity of the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A commercial product formulation on freshwater fish and unionids from the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.<br> <br> This project will specifically assess the sensitivity of multiple species of native fish (Table 1) and unionid mussels (Table 2) to the formulated <em>Pf</em>-CL145A product to evaluate its safety, significantly expanding the diversity of non-target organism sensitivity information available. Not only will these trials expand the sensitivity information already available for Pf-CL145A by testing more species of fish and unionids, but also by obtaining the first evaluation of the sensitivity of early life stages of native fish (&lt;1 year-old) and unionids (i.e., glochidia and juvenile [&lt;48-h post glochidia stage] mussels). This critical information will allow unionid conservationists to make informed choices on whether, when, and how to apply this tool to reduce potential impacts on unionids or their fish hosts. The toxicity trials will be conducted at UMESC with mussels (and mussel propagation expertise) provided by GNFH. The acute toxicity of the commercial product formulation of <em>Pf</em>-CL145A to fish and unionids will be assessed following standard testing guidelines for acute toxicity testing wherever possible and will conform to the strict data recording procedures required by Good Laboratory Practice regulations. The information developed in these trials will be essential for potential users of this tool to make informed management decisions as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs to limit dreissenid mussel populations and support unionid conservation and restoration efforts.<br> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/fish_table.jpg\\\\\"><br> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/unionid_table.jpg\\\\\"><br> <br> <strong>Objective 2</strong>: Prevent the spread of dreissenids by developing and demonstrating treatment protocols using the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A-based product to kill 100% of the planktonic larvae (veligers) in contained systems such as fish transport water or within fish hatcheries.<br> <br> Once established in a water body, dreissenid mussels are virtually impossible to eradicate without affecting the entire ecosystem. Therefore, preventing the spread of zebra and quagga mussels is the most effective and safest means of control. The larval stages of dreissenids, including the feeding veliger stage, are microscopic and swim suspended in the water column for up to three weeks before settling on surfaces on lake or river bottoms. Water containing these larval planktonic dreissenids can inadvertently be transferred to new water bodies by recreational users (i.e., in live wells and bait buckets). Although many fish hatchery managers treat transfer water with salt solutions to kill dreissenid larvae, having another tool to eliminate these larvae from the water without harming the organisms being transferred (e.g. fish or unionids) would be beneficial. Preliminary experiments indicate that dreissenid veligers are even more susceptible to the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A-based product than are attached stages (i.e., juvenile and adult mussels). The NYSM will develop and demonstrate (at bench scales) easy-to-implement veliger treatment protocols. Those protocols will then be “field” tested in collaboration with UMESC and GNFH by evaluating the treatments in commonly used fish transfer units.<br> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/zm_veligers3.jpg\\\\\"> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/zm_veligers4.jpg\\\\\"><br> <br> <strong>Objective 3</strong>: Develop application methods for using <em>Pf</em>-CL145A to reduce dreissenid populations within unionid restoration structures and within unionid beds. Assess implementation of potential integrated pest management strategies that incorporate the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A-based product as an aid in native unionid restoration.<br> <br> Zebra and quagga mussels are an imminent threat to unionid survival in and around the Great Lakes. Some natural resource managers consider existing dreissenid mussel populations to be the greatest threat to unionid populations, many of which are listed as threatened or endangered. Recent evidence indicates that dreissenid mussels are not only a threat to native mussels but they are disrupting the entire Great Lakes ecosystem – from the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food web all the way up to the most desirable game fish such as coho, lake trout and whitefish. Since there are currently no safe and effective ways to manage dreissenids in unionid beds, restoration efforts have focused on removing attached dreissenids from unionid shells, relocation, and propagation. Propagation cages holding thousands of juvenile unionids, can become encrusted with dreissenids and reduce water circulation (and food for unionids) within the structure, and dreissenid mussels can attach to the juvenile unionids themselves. Lake Pepin (Pool 4 of the Mississippi River) provides an excellent example of the impact of zebra mussels on unionid mussel propagation – unionid propagation in Lake Pepin was extremely successful prior to zebra mussel infestation but was discontinued due to the intense fouling of cages and native juvenile mussels after zebra mussel populations exploded in Lake Pepin.In close coordination with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Wisconsin DNR, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others, pilot field trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A product to control zebra mussels attached to native unionids or mussel propagation cage materials. The pilot studies will be completed in the UMESC mobile assay trailer, a self-contained mobile laboratory. Water from a local water body will be pumped through test vessels enclosed in the mobile laboratory where zebra mussels, attached to mussel propagation cage material and to native unionids, will be exposed under controlled conditions to the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A product. Test water containing the <em>Pf</em>-CL145A product will be disposed of according to procedures established by EPA or the state regulatory agency. Five test sites will be selected from Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes and rivers that have established zebra mussel populations in consultation with the respective state DNR. Mussel propagation cage material will be artificially “seeded” with zebra mussels in the fall of 2011. Pilot field trials will be completed in summer 2012 after non-target studies have been completed. Data from the non-target studies will be summarized and provided to the respective state DNR prior to conducting pilot field efficacy studies.

       "  'title': 'Compilation of watershed models for tributaries to the Great Lakes, United States, as of 2010, and identification of watersheds for future modeling for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'As part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) during 2009–10, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) compiled a list of existing watershed models that had been created for tributaries within the United States that drain to the Great Lakes. Established Federal programs that are overseen by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are responsible for most of the existing watershed models for specific tributaries. The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) uses the Large Basin Runoff Model to provide data for the management of water levels in the Great Lakes by estimating United States and Canadian inflows to the Great Lakes from 121 large watersheds. GLERL also simulates streamflows in 34 U.S. watersheds by a grid-based model, the Distributed Large Basin Runoff Model. The NOAA National Weather Service uses the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model to predict flows at river forecast sites. The USACE created or funded the creation of models for at least 30 tributaries to the Great Lakes to better understand sediment erosion, transport, and aggradation processes that affect Federal navigation channels and harbors. Many of the USACE hydrologic models have been coupled with hydrodynamic and sediment-transport models that simulate the processes in the stream and harbor near the mouth of the modeled tributary. Some models either have been applied or have the capability of being applied across the entire Great Lakes Basin; they are (1) the SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model, which was developed by the USGS; (2) the High Impact Targeting (HIT) and Digital Watershed models, which were developed by the Institute of Water Research at Michigan State University; (3) the Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L–THIA) model, which was developed by researchers at Purdue University; and (4) the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, which was developed by the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During 2010, the USGS used the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to create a hydrologic model for the Lake Michigan Basin to assess the probable effects of climate change on future groundwater and surface-water resources. The Water Availability Tool for Environmental Resources (WATER) model and the Analysis of Flows In Networks of CHannels (AFINCH) program also were used to support USGS GLRI projects that required estimates of streamflows throughout the Great Lakes Basin. This information on existing watershed models, along with an assessment of geologic, soils, and land-use data across the Great Lakes Basin and the identification of problems that exist in selected tributary watersheds that could be addressed by a watershed model, was used to identify three watersheds in the Great Lakes Basin for future modeling by the USGS. These watersheds are the Kalamazoo River Basin in Michigan, the Tonawanda Creek Basin in New York, and the Bad River Basin in Wisconsin. These candidate watersheds have hydrogeologic, land-type, and soil characteristics that make them distinct from each other, but that are representative of other tributary watersheds within the Great Lakes Basin. These similarities in the characteristics among nearby watersheds will enhance the usefulness of a model by improving the likelihood that parameter values from a previously modeled watershed could reliably be used in the creation of a model of another watershed in the same region. The software program Hydrological Simulation Program–Fortran (HSPF) was selected to simulate the hydrologic, sedimentary, and water-quality processes in these selected watersheds. HSPF is a versatile, process-based, continuous-simulation model that has been used extensively by the scientific community, has the ongoing technical support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and USGS, and provides a means to evaluate the effects that land-use changes or management practices might have on the simulated processes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Contaminant exposure of tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, nesting in the Great Lakes basin was assessed in 2010 to 2014. Tree swallow nestlings were collected from 69 sites which included multiple sites at some of the 27 Areas of Concern (AOCs) and at nine non-AOC sites. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) concentrations were measured in nestling stomach contents. Concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs were measured in nestling carcasses. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were measured in nestling plasma. Pooled dietary concentrations of total PAHs were highest at the Rouge River, MI AOC (1,856 ng/g wet weight) and lowest at White Lake, MI AOC (14 ng/g). Nestling PCB concentrations were highest at Waukegan Harbor, IL AOC (geometric mean = 5,908 ng/g) and lowest at a Green Mountain, MN (7 ng/g), a non-AOC. Nestling PBDE concentrations were highest at Torch Lake, MI AOC (72 ng/g) and lowest at Wild Rice Lake, MN (3 ng/g), a non-AOC. Drainages associated with Wurtsmith Air Force Base, MI (non-AOC) had the highest PFC plasma concentrations (1,649 ng/ml) compared to the lowest concentration at Torch Lake, MI AOC (21 ng/ml). Both PAH and PCB concentrations in nestling stomach contents were significantly correlated with concentrations reported in sediment from AOCs in another study. Concentrations of PCBs in mussels measured at AOCs in another study were also significantly correlated with PCB concentrations in tree swallow nestlings. Both PCB and PBDE concentrations were significantly correlated among diet, nestling carcasses, and sibling eggs measured in a companion study.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent investigations in the Detroit River have revealed renewed spawning activity by several important fishes, but little is known about their early life history requirements. We surveyed two main channel and two backwater areas in the lower Detroit River weekly from May to July 2007 to assess habitat use by larval fishes. Backwater areas included a soft-sediment embayment (FI) and a hard-sediment area (HIW). Main channel sites were located adjacent to each backwater area. Water temperature, velocity and clarity measurements and zooplankton samples were collected weekly. A macrophyte assessment was conducted in July. Growth and diet of larval yellow perch (<i>Perca flavescens</i>), bluegill (<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i>) and round goby (<i>Neogobius melanostomus</i>) were used to assess habitat quality. Macrophyte diversity and percent cover were higher and velocity lower at FI than HIW. Although larval fish diversity was highest in the main channel, yellow perch and bluegill larvae only grew beyond the yolk stage at FI, where they preferentially selected copepods, while <i>Daphnia</i> were selected in the main channel. Round goby ate harpacticoid copepods and <i>Daphnia</i> and grew at similar rates in HIW and the main channel. These data indicate that FI was a valuable nursery area for yellow perch and bluegill, whereas HIW was better suited to round goby. We only assessed two backwater areas, thus a complete census of wetland areas in the Detroit River is needed to identify valuable habitats. Restoration of shallow backwater areas is essential for rehabilitating fish populations and should be a priority in the Detroit River.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Hydraulic and water-quality data collection for the investigation of Great Lakes tributaries for Asian carp spawning and egg-transport suitability',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<p>If the invasive Asian carps (bighead carp&nbsp;<i>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</i>&nbsp;and silver carp&nbsp;<i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i>) migrate to the Great Lakes, in spite of the efforts to stop their advancement, these species will require the fast-flowing water of the Great Lakes tributaries for spawning and recruitment in order to establish a growing population. Two Lake Michigan tributaries (the Milwaukee and St. Joseph Rivers) and two Lake Erie tributaries (the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers) were investigated to determine if these tributaries possess the hydraulic and water-quality characteristics to allow successful spawning of Asian carps. To examine this issue, standard U.S.&nbsp;Geological Survey sampling protocols and instrumentation for discharge and water-quality measurements were used, together with differential global positioning system data for georeferencing. Non-standard data-processing techniques, combined with detailed laboratory analysis of Asian carp egg characteristics, allowed an assessment of the transport capabilities of each of these four tributaries. This assessment is based solely on analysis of observed data and did not utilize the collected data for detailed transport modeling.</p> <p>All four tributaries exhibited potential settling zones for Asian carp eggs both within the estuaries and river mouths and within the lower 100 kilometers (km) of the river. Dams played a leading role in defining these settling zones, with the exception of dams on the Sandusky River. The impoundments created by many of the larger dams on these rivers acted to sufficiently decelerate the flows and allowed the shear velocity to drop below the settling velocity for Asian carp eggs, which would allow the eggs to fall out of suspension and settle on the bottom where it is thought the eggs would perish. While three rivers exhibited these settling zones upstream of the larger dams, not all settling zones are likely to have such effects on egg transport. The Milwaukee River exhibited only a short settling zone upstream of the Grafton Dam, whereas the St. Joseph and Maumee Rivers both had extensive settling zones (&gt;5 km) behind major dams. These longer settling zones are likely to capture more eggs than shorter settling reaches. All four rivers exhibited settling zones at their river mouths, with the Lake Erie tributaries having much larger settling zones extending more than 10 km up the tributaries.</p> <p>While hydraulic data from all four rivers indicated settling of eggs is possible in some locations, all four rivers also exhibited sufficient temperatures, water-quality characteristics, turbulence, and transport times outside of settling zones for successful suspension and development of Asian carp eggs to the hatching stage before the threat of settlement. These observed data indicate that these four Great Lakes tributaries have sufficient hydraulic and water-quality characteristics to support successful spawning and recruitment of Asian carps. The data indicate that with the right temperature and flow conditions, river reaches as short as 25 km may allow Asian carp eggs sufficient time to develop to hatching. Additionally, examining the relation between critical shear velocity and mean velocity, egg settling appears to take place at mean velocities in the range of 15–25&nbsp;centimeters per second, a much lower value than is generally cited in the literature. A first-order estimate of the minimum transport velocity for Asian carp eggs in a river can be obtained by using mean flow depth and river substrate data, and curves were constructed to show this relation. These findings would expand the number of possible tributaries suitable for Asian carp spawning and contribute to the understanding of how hydraulic and water-quality information can be used to screen additional rivers in the future.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rivermouth ecosystems are areas where tributary waters mix with lentic near-shore waters and provide habitat for many Laurentian Great Lakes fish and wildlife species. Rivermouths are the interface between terrestrial activities that influence rivers and the ecologically important nearshore. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in consumers were measured from a range of rivermouths systems to address two questions: 1) What is the effect of rivermouth ecosystems and land cover on the isotopic composition of N available to rivermouth consumers? 2) Are rivermouth consumers composed of lake-like or river-like C? For question 1, data suggest that strong relationships between watershed agriculture and consumer N are weakened or eliminated at the rivermouth, in favor of stronger relationships between consumer N and depositional areas that may favor denitrification. For question 2, despite apparently large riverine inputs, consumers only occasionally appear river-like. More often consumers seem to incorporate large amounts of C from either the nearshore or primary production within the rivermouth itself. Rivermouths appear to be active C and N processing environments, thus necessitating their explicit incorporation into models estimating nearshore loading and possibly contributing to their importance to Great Lakes biota.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled \\\\\"Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan\\\\\". This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of three-dimensional point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana, on September 21, 2016. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using a YSI EcoMapper autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a YSI 6600 V2-4 bulkhead housing a YSI 6560FR fast response temperature/conductivity probe, YSI 6589FR fast response pH sensor, YSI 6150 ROX optical dissolved oxygen sensor, YSI 6136 turbidity sensor, YSI 6025 chlorophyll sensor, and YSI 6131 BGA-PC phycocyanin (blue-green algae) sensor. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the AUV completed the pre-programmed survey pattern of the nearshore zone. The AUV was programmed to continually undulate between the water surface and 4 feet above the bottom (dive angle of 15 degrees) as it moved at 2 knots between programmed waypoints along it survey mission path. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are improving the health of the Great Lakes sport and commercial fisheries by documenting sources and the determining the processes that control mercury entering food webs, and helping to evaluate the implications for public health. Our scientists will provide decision-makers with a scientific understanding of mercury-source profiles, the relative importance of the various sources, and the expected environmental responses to Great Lakes wasters and fisheries to altered mercury loading and restoration actions. This information is intended to inform and maximize the benefit of the Great Lakes restoration program. The USGS will develop mercury and methylmercury mass budgets for all five Great Lakes. This information will aid resource managers to understand how various restoration actions will affect mercury conditions differently among the five Great Lakes. In the absence of this information, prescribing corrective measures, and their outcomes, for unsafe mercury levels in sport and commercial fish are very difficult to ascertain. In addition to source identification, this project quantifies mechanisms and rates of methylmercury degradation and atmosphere-lake exchange of gaseous mercury across all five Great Lakes. In FY 2014, efforts funded by this template will focus on science synthesis from the previous years of data collection, and to develop three manuscripts describing the new overall scientific understanding of mercury and methylmercury sources and cycling for the Great Lakes.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Our scientists will provide decision makers with a scientific understanding of mercury processes that will help them to recommend actions that could help restore a healthier fishery. Elevated levels of mercury are observed in sport and commercial fish across the Great Lakes basin, which result in consumption advisories and beneficial use impairments. However, a good understanding of the primary sources and the factors regulating greater versus lesser levels of mercury in fish among the Great Lakes has remained unresolved.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> The study has identified two sources of methlymercury (the form of mercury in consumable fish) that were previously unrecognized - stream discharge was previously the only known source. The first is methylmercury formation in the water column of the lakes, and which has a controlling influence on the spatial distribution of methylmercury in surface waters of the Great Lakes. We have documented that in the nearshore zone where annually large masses of Cladophora (filamentous algae) wash ashore, significant methylmercury formation occurs. In combination, the robust data set and the new understanding of methylmercury sources for the Great Lakes will help inform decision makers and restoration managers on effective steps toward reducing fish mercury contamination. This project is linked to two other USGS and USEPA funded GLRI efforts to develop, for the first time a whole ecosystem (lakes and watersheds) model that will allow us to forecast responses of Great Lakes fish mercury levels to changes, such as: reduced mercury loading, changes in nutrient loading, and climate change.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> During 2014-2016, researchers at the USGS Lake Erie Biological Station in collaboration with the University of Toledo used three different gears to try to capture eggs and larvae of Grass Carp. Bongo nets, so named because when held up they resemble Bongo drums, are fine-mesh, cone-shaped nets that are towed through the water for 5 minutes. These nets capture floating eggs (Grass Carp eggs float) and any small fish that can’t swim fast enough to get out of the way. Light traps are fished at night and capture fish that are attracted to light – like Grass Carp. Light traps are fished for about 1 hour at a time in backwater areas where small fish seek cover from current and predators and abundant food. Dipnets are small, fine-mesh nets that a researcher can use to sample areas that can’t be sampled as easily with Bongo nets or light traps. Each of these gears were used at least once a week June through September (dipnets were discontinued after the 2014 season). These gears were also be used for three consecutive days during one or more high-flow events. Grass Carp prefer to spawn when water flow is high, because high flows provide the best conditions for eggs to remain suspended to complete development.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> There are at least two direct benefits of this research. First, if we capture eggs or larvae of Grass Carp we will demonstrate absolutely that Grass Carp are reproducing successfully in the Sandusky River. Second, using methods to estimate the age, in days, of larvae and the developmental stage of eggs we can determine when, within approximately an hour, and where, within a few hundred meters, Grass Carp spawned. With this information, and knowledge of river conditions when spawning occurred, we can begin to devise methods to prevent or disrupt spawning.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>As of July 2016 we have successfully captured Grass Carp eggs on 5 dates during three separate high-flow events. All of these events were in 2015. Eggs were tested genetically and confirmed to be Grass Carp. To date no larval Grass Carp have been captured</li> <li>Simulations of egg drift have permitted estimation of spawning and hatching locations. Results are being summarized in a peer-reviewed publication that is in preparation.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> Kocovsky, P. M., H. Embke, C. Mayer, and S. Qian. 2015.

       "  'title': 'Toxicity Testing of Mayflies',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> A number of field studies have shown that mayflies (Ephemeroptera) tend to be more sensitive than other benthic macroinvertebrate taxa to elevated levels of total dissolved solids in streams impacted by mining. Until relatively recently, difficulties with culturing have precluded the use of mayflies as laboratory toxicity testing organisms; however, researchers at Stroud Water Research Center have found parthenogenic species that readily reproduce under laboratory conditions, and researchers at the US EPA EERD laboratory have developed laboratory cultured diets for mayflies that will help to move toward standardization of methods. Recent efforts at the Illinois Natural History Survey built upon these efforts and developed a method for conducting full life-cycle toxicity tests with the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer using a modification of the EERD laboratory cultured diet. Endpoints for the full life-cycle test included survival to pre-emergent nymph (PEN) stage, number of days to PEN stage, percent emergence, pre-egg-laying live weight, and number of eggs produced. Initial tests were conducted with sodium salts of chloride, sulfate, and nitrate. In acute (96-h) exposures, LC50s for C. triangulifer were approximately one half to two thirds of those generated in our laboratory with Ceriodaphnia dubia. In the full life-cycle chloride test, the most sensitive endpoints were survival to PEN stage, and mean number of days to PEN stage, with a maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 267 mg Cl-/L. The fact that major ion toxicity to standard laboratory test organisms like cladocerans, amphipods, and fish, are dependent on the ionic composition of water or an effluent has been well established. Researchers at the US EPA laboratory in Duluth, MN, previously developed statistical models to predict toxicity of high TDS waters to standard test organisms based on ionic composition, and current efforts in that laboratory are aimed at improving the model. It is known that for crustaceans and fish, solutions tend to be more toxic when dominated by particular major ions (i.e., K+, Mg+, HCO3-), and toxicity due to several individual ions, including SO42-, is reduced when solutions contain more than one cation. However, essentially nothing is known about how ionic composition influences responses of C. triangulifer to elevated major ions. Because this mayfly appears to be more sensitive to elevated major ions than other laboratory cultured test organisms, studies with this organism that could contribute to the development of the new ion toxicity model are required. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'title': 'Forecasting Potential Phragmites Coastal Invasion Corridors',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will use remote sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors. Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat. Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed ( <em>Phragmites</em>).<br> &nbsp; <h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4> <strong>Goals:</strong> <ul> <li>Identify current <em>Phragmites</em> distribution in the Great Lakes coastal zone,</li> <li>detect potential areas vulnerable to invasion due to influences such as altered water levels, nutrient and sediment loading, and shoreline development, and</li> <li>communicate project results to researchers, managers, policy makers, and the general public to guide future management and restoration efforts throughout the Great Lakes basin.</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Objectives:</strong> <ul> <li>Use remote sensing to map the current extent of <em>Phragmites</em> in the Great Lakes coastal zone,</li> <li>assess areas vulnerable to the spread of <em>Phragmites</em> under predicted climate-change scenarios and environmental influences (e.g., nutrients, hydrology, shoreline development), and</li> <li>give presentations, write a USGS fact sheet, create a web-based decision-support tool, and begin work toward communicating project results to the public and decision makers verbally and in journal publications.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The basin-wide map of current <em>Phragmites</em> distribution that will be produced will be useful to natural resource managers and will provide a basis for basin-wide efforts to control&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>, especially in areas where preservation of native biodiversity is particularly important. As nothing like this currently exists, such a map will prove invaluable for controlling the spread of this invasive species. Wetlands with previously undiscovered stands of <em>Phragmites</em> will be identified, and restoration efforts can be directed at these areas. Predicting corridors for future invasion by assessing vulnerability of exposed bottomlands to expansion will allow managers to target and prioritize control efforts, especially in relation to current coastal wetland restoration efforts.<br> <br> This project addresses mission, vision, and multiple priorities identified in the USGS Strategic Plan and the USGS – Great Lakes Science Center Strategic Plan. It is consistent with the U.S. Climate Change Science Program strategic goals, the research goals of multiple programs within USGS (i.e., Ecosystems, Invasive Species, Fisheries: Aquatic and Endangered Resources), and initiatives endorsed by the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The USGS – Great Lakes Science Center (USGS – GLSC) has the mission, staff, facilities, and equipment to lead the cutting-edge research involved in this basin-wide effort.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Approach</h4> <strong><em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;Mapping</strong>&nbsp;– A map of the current <em>Phragmites</em> distribution along the U.S. Great Lakes coastal zone (10-km buffer inland from shore) will be generated and published as a web-based decision-support tool.<br> <br> 1. Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) will procure the 260 multi-temporal radar imagery scenes (dual-polarized ALOS PALSAR) necessary to map the U.S. Great Lakes shoreline and will georegister the scenes to within 1-2 pixels.<br> <br> 2. Using the georectified scenes, Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) will map current extent of <em>Phragmites</em> by basin using algorithms developed and tested for this purpose.<br> <br> 3. Ground-truthing of the mapping effort will be performed by MTRI. Field crews will collect pre-selected GPS points and digital photos of <em>Phragmites</em> and other vegetation and will transmit these data to MTRI image analysts through a Google Earth field tracking system.<br> <br> 4. Preliminary maps of each basin will be distributed via a web-based tool supported by USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) under a separate GLRI project. Validation by MTRI of maps to 95% confidence using ground-truth data will begin in FY10 and will be finalized in FY11.<br> <br> <strong>Vulnerability Assessment (Predicting Corridors of Expansion)</strong>&nbsp;- To understand the large-scale factors influencing&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em> distribution, GIS analyses and statistical methods will be used to relate current <em>Phragmites</em> extent to variables such as, but not limited to, slope and topography, nutrient loading to the coastal zone, proximity to urban and agricultural land-use types, shoreline development, and water depth. The major influencing factors will be used to develop a GIS modeling framework to identify areas vulnerable to invasion. Using these FY10 results, FY11 efforts will advance prediction of <em>Phragmites</em> expansion in the coastal zone given the water-level scenarios of current climate-change models.<br> <br> 1. USGS -GLSC will obtain LIDAR non-bare earth topographic and bathymetric data as 1-m DEMs from NOAA Coastal Services Center and USACE Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX). Other bathymetric data sources will be researched and acquired, if available, for the shoreline extent from Cleveland, OH to Port Huron, MI, where turbidity precluded collection of LIDAR data.<br> <br> 2. The bathymetric data will be converted to slopes and water-depth contours for a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m drop in water level or other relevant water-level scenarios determined by downscaled climate models. LIDAR data also will be analyzed for geomorphic obstructions (e.g., bluffs) to <em>Phragmites</em> expansion. Substrate data will be requested from USACE. A GIS data layer of land use will be generated from the publicly available MIRIS data set. Tributary nutrient-load data and nutrient data from the SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model will be acquired from USGS CIDA and the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center, respectively. Water-level data will be obtained from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory website and converted to depth using the LIDAR bathymetric data.<br> <br> 3. General linear modeling and regression analysis will be used to determine significant relationships, if any, between current&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em> occurrence and the above environmental variables (slope, topography, nutrient and sediment loading, land use, shoreline development, water depth, water-level fluctuation).<br> <br> 4. To identify areas vulnerable to invasion, we first will map potential wetland area for four water-level scenarios predicted by downscaled climate models or predetermined (i.e., current 2009 levels and a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m drop in water level). The following two criteria will be used to identify potential wetland area: 1) being at an elevation where mean high water level is between 0.1 m and 2 m and 2) having a substrate other than bedrock. Vulnerable areas will be identified as regions within the potential wetland area with a slope appropriate for&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em> growth (as identified in #3 above) and with a topographic corridor linking it to the current&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em> population. Highly vulnerable areas will be identified where nutrients, shoreline development, or other significant variables suggest greater probability for <em>Phragmites</em> expansion.<br> <br> 5. The vulnerability maps for each of the water-level scenarios will be published alongside the&nbsp; <em>Phragmites&nbsp;</em>map in the web-based tool. Users will be able to overlay water-level contours for each of the scenarios as well as sites identified as biodiversity protection areas by The Nature Conservancy and other organizations.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> 1. Through a cooperative effort with Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI), a spatial analyst lab, we used satellite data (PALSAR) to create a basin-wide map of <em>Phragmites</em> in the Great Lakes. The mapping effort also was supported by GLRI funds from the USFWS. The basin-wide map of the US coastal zone shows variability in the distribution of&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>, with certain regions (e.g., western Lake Erie, southern Lake Huron, Green Bay of Lake Michigan) supporting extensive&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>. This mapping product represents mature invasive <em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;stands that are 0.2 ha or larger. Map accuracy was determined using an extensive network of field validation points. The type of data and analysis methods used do not easily map the native <em>Phragmites</em> or sparse stands at the expansion front.<br> <br> 2. Many climate models for the Great Lakes predict lower lake levels, which can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as <em>Phragmites</em>. Using LIDAR data that were collected as part of a NOAA GLRI project, we determined what bottomlands may be exposed under reduced lake-level scenarios and become potential corridors for <em>Phragmites</em> invasion. We performed a simple vulnerability analysis related to proximity to current <em>Phragmites</em> stands to assist managers with early detection and control.<br> <br> 3. We have preliminary results from a more rigorous vulnerability analysis that involves compiling large-scale, GIS-based environmental drivers for the Great Lakes basin and relating them to current <em>Phragmites</em> distribution. This represents a new frontier in large-scale <em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;ecology that has never before been performed. Preliminary results indicate that three primary variables (i.e., nitrogen concentration, proximity to agriculture, and population density) are associated with extensive invasive <em>Phragmites</em> stands. Using species distribution modeling, we are using key environmental variables and data on the mapped <em>Phragmites</em> to create a spatial habitat suitability index that indicates areas that are highly vulnerable to <em>Phragmites</em> invasion. This vulnerability map can be used by managers for early detection, monitoring, and control, especially in areas being restored under the GLRI.<br> <br> 4. Scientists from the USGS Great Lakes Science Center worked with staff at the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics to make the mapping data available to the public using the GLRI GeoNetwork. The GeoNetwork is primarily a metadata catalog that describes the availability and structure of geospatial data sets produced by GLRI projects but also supports the graphical interpretation of these products through interactive maps that allow users to view and print depictions of available data at custom scales ( <a href=\\\\\"https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home\\\\\">https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home</a>). An online decision support tool is being developed to allow users to access the mapping and modeling data produced in this study.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> <strong>Poster Presentations</strong><br> Galbraith, D., M.

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> This study will generate bed sediment toxicity and benthic community data needed to test two related hypotheses that address the two criteria for delisting the benthos BUI. The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC (in three tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River) are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from control sites located outside (generally upstream from) the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference (control) sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). The component metrics of the BAP include: SPP (species richness), HBI (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index), DOM3 (Dominance-3), PMA (Percent Model Affinity), and DIV (species diversity). The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site. Bed-sediment sizes will be characterized by either the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sediment Laboratory or NYSDEC subcontract laboratory using a subsample (split) obtained from the composite bed sediment-toxicity sample.

This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of continuous measurements of nearshore currents in Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana (USGS 04092788). Currents were measured and averaged over 10-minute intervals using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz ChannelMaster acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) mounted to the eastern most round protection cell in the breakwater wall and the instrument was oriented 142.1 degrees from true North. The ADVM was configured with a 6-meter blanking distance, ten 8 meter measurement cells, and a total profiling distance of 86 meters from the face of the instrument. The average depth of the transducers below the water surface was approximately 2.3 meters and the physical coordinates of the instrument in the Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16N WGS84 projection are 464087.2 meters East, 4611222.4 meters North. The instrument was deployed on May 18, 2016 and recovered on October 24, 2016.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is continuing to develop and evaluate existing and new dreissenid mussel control tools for use in an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program for dreissenid mussels.&nbsp; Information developed will help guide the management and control of dreissenid mussels in open water environments and it will determine how restoration efforts may be implemented after dreissenid mussel infestations occur. The USGS has conducted a rigorous evaluation of Zequanox for dreissenid mussel control including recent work to evaluate the non-target animal impacts to the critical Great Lakes fish species, lake trout and lake sturgeon. Additional work has been completed to evaluate the effects of Zequanox exposure on invertebrate prey species and the early life stages of fathead minnows. The USGS has conducted studies to use alternative control tools for dreissenid mussel control including the use of electrified fields and carbon dioxide.&nbsp; The USGS has recently developed a partnership with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center (MAISRC) and the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District (MCWD) which will leverage funding to initiate a study to develop rapid response treatment protocols for the eradication of localized dreissenid mussel infestations.<br> <br> The USGS has partnered with the Tipp of the Mitt Watershed District, the University of Michigan and state agencies to evaluate the open-water application of Zequanox in uncontained open-water treatments. In conjunction with the Tipp of the Mitt project, a partnership was initiated with the University of Wisconsin-Platteville engineering department to design and evaluate Zequanox mixing and open-water application systems and develop large-scale spray atomization equipment for use in developing toxicant laden particles for ingestion by, and control of dreissenid mussels.&nbsp; The USGS in collaboration with Wayne State University is investigating the use of algae-based components for disruption of dreissenid mussel spawning. In collaboration with the Great Lakes Commission, the USGS continues to provide development and support of the Invasive Mussel Collaborative (IMC).&nbsp; The collaborative hosts routine educational webinars, distributes weekly dreissenid mussel science and news updates, and provides a one-stop shop for dreissenid mussel information.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> This project provides critical information across the Great Lakes Basin and the United States for the management, control, and early detection of dreissenid mussels in open-water environments and related ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management.&nbsp; This project benefits the American people by providing the mechanism to leverage resources and develop collaborations to answer critical research questions and to develop dreissenid control technologies.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>A study to evaluate the safety of Zequanox to nontarget macroinvertebrates found that exposure at the maximum approved concentration and exposure duration caused no significant mortality or treatment-related histopathological changes to amphipods (<em>Gammarus lacustris</em>) and mayfly nymphs (<em>Hexagenia</em> spp).</li> <li>A study to evaluate the effects of Zequanox exposure on spawning and early life stages of the fathead minnow (<em>Pimephalas promelas</em>) found no significant effect on survival and condition of adult and newly hatched fry, egg deposition, and hatchability. Preliminary findings of a study to evaluate the non-target animal impacts of Zequanox exposure to the critical Great Lakes fish species, lake sturgeon (<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em>) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) found little to no impact to lake sturgeon and moderate impact on the survival and growth of lake trout.</li> <li>Preliminary findings of a study to evaluate the use of electrified fields to control dreissenid mussels found that significant mortality was observed after 24 hours of continuous exposure to pulse direct current at voltage gradients of ~30V/cm. These findings indicate that dreissenids are highly resistive to the effects of electrified fields.</li> <li>Preliminary findings of a study to evaluate the use of carbon dioxide to control dreissenid mussels in cool water (12°C) found that elevated CO2 induced narcotization of mussels within 24 h and caused loss of byssal attachment. Significant mortality was observed in extended exposure (48-96 h) to carbon dioxide.</li> <li>Experiments recently found that treatment of quagga mussels with <em>Microcystis</em> inhibited spawning and fertilization success. On-going experiments aim to identify the active components within the algae that reduce reproductive success of quagga mussels.&nbsp; If successful, we can test these components on potential biocontrols in mesocosm experiments.</li> <li>A study to evaluate Taqman probes for species identification found that using zebra mussel-specific primers and Taqman probes could accurately identify DNA from zebra mussels.</li> </ul> <h4>Products</h4> <ul> <li>The Invasive Mussel Collaborative was developed and allows for a one-stop shop for dreissenid mussel research, literatures and resources.

       "  'abstract': \"<h4>Description of Work</h4> At two of Wisconsin's Areas of Concern (AOCs) on Lake Michigan, the Sheboygan River AOC and Milwaukee Estuary AOC, the USGS will assess whether sediment toxicity from PCBs, PAHs, selected metals, ammonia, or dissolved oxygen is present at acutely toxic or chronically toxic concentrations using sediment toxicity tests conducted with amphipods and midges. Study planning and literature search have been completed. Sediment was collected in October 2016 from sites in the two AOCs and sites in two non-AOC comparison sites. Assesments will be done at two additional sites: Kewaunee River and Oak Creek. Laboratory toxicity tests and chemical analyses are in progress, including sediment toxicity testing and some chemical testing at the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center. Upon receipt and acceptance of all data in 2017, we will complete data analyses and complete a first draft of the interpretive report. <h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4> The goal of the study is to provide data on potential sediment toxicity to benthos and inform management decisions regarding possible removal of the “Degraded Benthos” beneficial use impairment (BUI) at the Sheboygan River AOC and the Milwaukee Estuary AOC. The objectives of the study are to: (1) Characterize sediment toxicity and relationships between toxicity and contaminant concentrations, and (2) Compare results to previous studies of sediment contamination, sediment toxicity, and benthic communities. This study addresses Focus Area 1—Toxic Substances and Areas of Concern, specifically the Areas of Concern portion of that focus area, in the Draft Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Action Plan II for FY15-19. It also fits into the USGS AOC Science Theme. This project has direct relevance to GLRI Objective 1 by providing data and interpretation toward Area of Concern Beneficial Use Impairments Removal, as an Action Plan Measure of Progress. A toxicity assessment of the river adjacent to the arsenic-contaminated area of the Kewaunee marsh will help the Wisconsin DNR to determine whether habitat remediation is needed in the river or whether efforts can focus on the marsh. An assessment of sediment toxicity in Oak Creek will provide the Wisconsin DNR with information to support efforts for aquatic habitat remediation in this important Milwaukee area watershed of Lake Michigan. The study addresses Focus Area 4–Habitat and Wildlife Protection and Restoration. <h4>Products</h4> Results for the AOCs (Sheboygan River and Milwaukee Estuary) and comparison non-AOCs (Manitowoc River and Root River) would be submitted as an interpretive report to a journal for publication. Upon review and acceptance, all data will be made publicly available on the web.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We use aging techniques, ploidy analysis, and otolith microchemistry to assess whether four grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella captured from the Sandusky River, Ohio were the result of natural reproduction within the Lake Erie Basin. All four fish were of age 1 +. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that these fish were not aquaculture-reared and that they were most likely the result of successful reproduction in the Sandusky River. First, at least two of the fish were diploid; diploid grass carp cannot legally be released in the Great Lakes Basin. Second, strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios were elevated in all four grass carp from the Sandusky River, with elevated Sr:Ca ratios throughout the otolith transect, compared to grass carp from Missouri and Arkansas ponds. This reflects the high Sr:Ca ratio of the Sandusky River, and indicates that these fish lived in a high-strontium environment throughout their entire lives. Third, Sandusky River fish were higher in Sr:Ca ratio variability than fish from ponds, reflecting the high but spatially and temporally variable strontium concentrations of southwestern Lake Erie tributaries, and not the stable environment of pond aquaculture. Fourth, Sr:Ca ratios in the grass carp from the Sandusky River were lower in their 2011 growth increment (a high water year) than the 2012 growth increment (a low water year), reflecting the observed inverse relationship between discharge and strontium concentration in these rivers. We conclude that these four grass carp captured from the Sandusky River are most likely the result of natural reproduction within the Lake Erie Basin.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Invasive Phragmites: Prevention, Monitoring, and Control Strategies in an Integrated Pest Management Framework',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The invasive form of <em>Phragmites australis</em> (common reed) is a well-established pest in many parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including designated Areas of Concern. New innovative control options that sustainably target the competitive advantage often enjoyed by <em>Phragmites</em> and other invasive plants will contribute to a broad Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy. This project targets the microorganisms that may help <em>Phragmites</em> spread and will employ a molecular genetic approach to silence the genes in <em>Phragmites</em> that give it a competitive edge over many native plants. This project helped build and will continue to be closely aligned with the Great Lakes Phragmites Collaborative that focuses on the people side of <em>Phragmites</em> IPM. Additional collaborative groups (e.g., Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and Phragmites Management) are being created through this work. Into FY2014 we will use the encouraging results of this project to emphasize how this work adds several new dimensions to the IPM strategy for <em>Phragmites</em> and other invasive plant species. The project will continue development of the Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and <em>Phragmites</em> Management, including completion of a science agenda for microbial symbiosis research. Fungal endophytes will be isolated and sequenced from several <em>Phragmites</em> stands and experiments to test endophyte-control and soil-restoration strategies will be initiated at field sites located in or near AOCs. Bacterial endophytes in <em>Phragmites</em> will be analyzed and their role in nitrogen fixation will be studied to explore contributions to the invasion process. Similarly, transcriptome data for <em>Phragmites</em> will be analyzed to identify target gene sequences for silencing. Experiments will be conducted to refine vectors for <em>Phragmites</em> and explore how other invasive plants (e.g., Oriental Bittersweet) could be managed by silencing select genes. Finally, the regulatory hurdles for implementation of new control strategies will be examined.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The progress made on this project is encouraging, because this type of control could be customized for other invasive species. A goal of this research is to create a completely species- and trait-specific treatment framework that could be applied to a suite of invasive species and provide another tool for resource managers. That means that land managers may be able to treat rapidly expanding or well established stands of an invasive species without having detrimental effects on other, non-target plant or animal species. The effects of gene silencing are transient, in that they cannot spread within the plant or be transferred to offspring. There is a great deal of excitement about this research in the management community and the topic remains one of the most visited pages on the Great Lakes&nbsp;Phragmites&nbsp;Collaborative webpage ( <a href=\\\\\"http://greatlakesphragmites.net/\\\\\">http://greatlakesphragmites.net/</a>). These results and the overall direction of this project directly support the broader Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach being developed for&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;and many other invasive plants. There are many opportunities to work with the existing partners (e.g., SEMCOG, USFWS, TNC, GLC, DU) to build on this work, integrate with IPM efforts, and target our field trials in AOCs or other high priority sites.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Preliminary results of a small study conducted in summer 2012 by Dr. Rusty Rodriguez (Symbiogenics), Dr. Regina Redman (University of Washington), and Dr. Kurt Kowalski (USGS – Great Lakes Science Center) indicated that treatment of fungal endophytes (i.e., microbes found in all parts of plants) with the general use fungicide can decrease the number of new&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;stems growing compared to control plots. This initial study was conducted at a very small scale and did not allow for treatment of juvenile plants, but the results were promising. That study provided the underpinnings for a more comprehensive field study in 2013 that is designed to provide proof of concept that controlling endophytes can decrease the growth of&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>. This study will elucidate whether fungicide application affects the biomass production (above and below ground), stem density, and percent cover of&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>. It will also examine the effects of the treatments on native plant species diversity. This effort will produce the first comprehensive results that document how fungal associates can affect growth of the invasive&nbsp; <em>Phragmites</em>&nbsp;and provide a foundation for additional experiments on the path toward new control tools.<br> <br> The USGS has partnered with Dr. Edward Golenberg at Wayne State University to examine the potential use of gene silencing in <em>Phragmites</em> management. Gene silencing is a process whereby the genetic message necessary to code for particular proteins is blocked (silenced), thus blocking the development of specific traits. For instance, if researchers target and silence the genetic code essential for photosynthesis, a plant will not be able to harness the sun’s energy and growth will be stunted. The project team continues to make incremental progress toward the application of this technology as a form of <em>Phragmites</em> management. Researchers at Wayne State have identified a suitable transmission vector for monocot species and completed several ‘proof of concept’ studies silencing the photosynthetic ability of plants similar to <em>Phragmites</em>. These successes and analysis of the <em>Phragmites</em> will allow expanded lab testing of gene silencing techniques in <em>Phragmites</em>.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> <strong>Webpage</strong> on USGS Phragmites Management Support ( <a href=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/templates/phragmites_management_support.html\\\\\">http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/templates/phragmites_management_support.html</a>) prepared by Dr. Kurt Kowalski, U.S. Geological Survey<br> <br> Braun, H. and K.

       "  'abstract': \"These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled 'Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan'. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of continuous measurements of nearshore currents in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach at Jackson Park at Hyde Park, Illinois (USGS 04092440). Currents were measured and averaged over 10-minute intervals using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz ChannelMaster acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) mounted to the north end of the breakwater wall and oriented 60 degrees from true North. The ADVM was configured with a 6-meter blanking distance, ten 8 meter measurement cells, and a total profiling distance of 86 meters from the face of the instrument. The average depth of the transducers below the water surface was approximately 2.5 meters and the physical coordinates of the instrument in the Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16N WGS84 projection are 452834.7 meters East, 4626018.5 meters North. The instrument was deployed on July 14, 2015 and recovered on November 23, 2015.\",\n",

This is an extension of prior work at the site that has been used by the Manistique River and Harbor Remediation Team (comprised of managers and scientists from USEPA GLNPO, USEPA ORD, NOAA, USACOE, USGS and the state of Michigan) to guide plans for delisting activities. Riparian spiders are important mediators of contaminant flux from aquatic systems to nearby terrestrial habitats. Aquatic insects accumulate contaminants in their larval form, and transport these contaminants to terrestrial ecosystems in their adult bodies. Spiders are a key predator of aquatic insects, and many species feed almost exclusively on adult aquatic insects. Spider concentrations closely track ambient sediment concentrations, making them ideal indicators of ambient sediment concentrations and of ecosystem recovery from sediment remediation. Traditional species for contaminant exposure studies such as tetragnathid (long-jawed spiders) and araneid (orb-weaving spiders) will be targeted for these studies. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>In Lake Michigan, diets of planktivorous and benthivorous fishes have varied over the past decades, in part owing to food web changes. To update diet information and compare them to a similar effort in 1994–1995, we analyzed the diets of seven benthivorous and planktivorous fish species collected along two northern Lake Michigan transects that spanned nearshore (18 m), intermediate (46 m), and offshore (91, 110, 128 m) bottom depths during spring, summer, and autumn of 2010. Calanoid copepods (e.g., Limnocalanus macrurus, Leptodiaptomus sicilis, and Senecella calanoides) comprised a majority of the diets in at least one season for all sizes of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), bloater (Coregonus hoyi), and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). Similarly, Mysis diluviana was the highest proportion in at least one season for large sizes of alewife, bloater, and rainbow smelt, as well as slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii). The diets of the remaining two species, ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), were dominated by herbivorous cladocerans or dreissenid mussels, respectively. Interspecific diet overlap was minimal at 18 and 46 m. In offshore waters, however, overlap was relatively high, driven by frequent consumption of Mysis. Relative to 1994–1995, 2010 diets revealed increased feeding on calanoid copepods and Mysis, with corresponding declining consumption of Diporeia spp. and herbivorous cladocerans. Relative diet weight was also higher in 1994–1995 than in 2010 for small and large bloater and both sculpin species. We hypothesize that the shifts in diets are reflective of community-level changes in invertebrate prey availability.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this report we describe how we adapted two techniques for sampling lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and other fish early life history stages to meet our research needs in the Detroit River, a deep, flowing Great Lakes connecting channel. First, we developed a buoy-less method for sampling fish eggs and spawning activity using egg mats deployed on the river bottom. The buoy-less method allowed us to fish gear in areas frequented by boaters and recreational anglers, thus eliminating surface obstructions that interfered with recreational and boating activities. The buoy-less method also reduced gear loss due to drift when masses of floating aquatic vegetation would accumulate on buoys and lines, increasing the drag on the gear and pulling it downstream. Second, we adapted a D-frame drift net system formerly employed in shallow streams to assess larval lake sturgeon dispersal for use in the deeper (&gt;8 m) Detroit River using an anchor and buoy system.',\n",

A similar pattern of declining exposure was present in the 2010s as well. Although exposure to PCBs in eggs along the Sheboygan River at sites downstream of Sheboygan Falls has declined by ~60 % since the mid-1990s (8.69 down to 3.27 μg/g) there still seems to be residual pockets of contamination that are exposing some individuals (~25 %) to PCB contamination, similar to exposure found in the 1990s.

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/10-improving-asian-carpeDNA-techniques-B-10.jpg\\\\\"><br> This spring (2014) we will measure Asian carp eDNA over time at a Missouri River site downstream of multiple spawning areas before and during spawning. We will measure the amount of Asian carp eDNA in water samples. The amount of eDNA will be related to the numbers of eggs and larvae counted in matched samples (water samples taken at the same time and place). The time since the eDNA was released by the carp will be estimated and these results will be related to the average age of AC eggs and larvae in matched samples. We will also test for substances which interfere with the eDNA measurement techniques and can lead to false negatives.<br> <br> We will also be validating markers developed by USGS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as part of an inter-laboratory validation study coordinated by USGS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Whitney Genetics Laboratory. A suite of new markers will be evaluated for incorporation by the FWS into its eDNA surveillance program. One potential marker is a USGS-designed allelic discrimination marker which can detect the DNA of bighead carp and silver carp in a single sample, potentially reducing by half the number of analyses required.<br> <br> Additionally, samples will be processed from multiple environments to assess the utility of the MST-developed markers for bacteria specific to Asian carp. Pending these analyses, MST-specific markers will be validated for potential incorporation in eDNA surveillance programs.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> This project builds on our previous successes at understanding eDNA in a laboratory setting, and will extend that work into the field. Results from the spawning study will have relevance for prediction of population sizes and identification of spawning areas and spawning events. Newly developed methods will help identify the age of eDNA in a sample, and this will be useful in predicting whether the eDNA came from a live fish rather than a carcass or waste from a fish-eating bird. We will also develop methods to detect the effects of substances which mask the presence of eDNA in environmental samples used in monitoring; this effort is vital to avoid false negatives in monitoring samples. Overall, our results will lead to better interpretation of eDNA detections and better enable determination of the linkage between detected DNA in environmental samples and the presence of live fish.<br> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/projects/invasive_species/images/10-improving-asian-carpeDNA-techniques-A-10.jpg\\\\\"><br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>In fish kept in tanks in the laboratory, the amount of eDNA can predict the population density (g/L) of fish in the water, within a factor of 10.</li> <li>Temperature did not change eDNA amounts, but feeding increased eDNA in water from tanks of Asian carp, suggesting that outside of the spawning season, most eDNA comes from intestinal wall cells that are shed in feces.</li> <li>In a laboratory experiment, most eDNA from sperm in the water was rapidly degraded within a couple days, but a small fraction persisted for at least a few weeks.</li> <li>Substances present in some water samples can mask the presence of eDNA. With partners at the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, we are developing methods to detect inhibition.</li> <li>Fish-eating birds shed silver carp DNA in their waste for up to 1 week following a single meal of silver carp.</li> <li>Silver carp DNA in fish-eating bird waste or in slime of silver carp deposited on metal sheets persisted for &gt;28 d despite being exposed to temperatures &gt;30°C and natural sunlight conditions.</li> <li>USGS coordinated an inter-laboratory validation study with FWS and USACE that validated a new eDNA extraction kit. The kit is now in use by the FWS-Whitney Genetics Laboratory to process samples for the FWS eDNA surveillance program. The new extraction kit costs ~75% less than the old kit, takes less time to use and extracts more DNA than the previous kit.</li> <li>Multiple new markers have been designed for the detection of the DNA of bighead carp and silver carp including a new allelic discrimination markers and a series of increasing length \\\\\"stair-step\\\\\" markers.

       "  'title': 'Understanding Nutrient Loading Impacts on Lake Ontario Nearshore Waters at the Niagara River Connecting Channel',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The Great Lakes ecosystem has undergone major changes over the last two decades related to the invasion of Dreissenid mussels, increased water clarity, increased benthic algae and associated water quality problems. For reasons not yet entirely understood, and that have bi-national significance, water column total phosphorus has not significantly increased over the last decade but the relative percent of the more biologically available dissolved phosphorus has increased. The filtering action of Dreissenid mussels has been shown to increase concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in the water column immediately above mussel beds and this had been hypothesized as one explanation for the increase of benthic algae. However, the Lake Ontario 2008 CSMI monitoring year’s assessment of nearshore water eutrophication problems concluded that localized eutrophication problems could not be explained by the presence of mussel beds alone. Tributary nutrient inputs always appeared to be a common factor related to localized nearshore problems. This work will expand the nearshore work begun in 2008, as part of a binational assessment coordinated by the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan, to develop better understand the connection between tributary nutrient inputs and Lake Ontario nearshore water quality and nutrient fate and transport with the aim of identifying potential management actions. This nearshore work will complement offshore work to be coordinated by US and Canadian Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan partners through the use of the research vessels Lake Guardian and Limnos. The maintenance of flow gaging systems and regular monitoring programs are essential to understand nutrient loadings and impacts. This work will allow the maintenance of gaging stations and the collection of nutrient samples from six major, and several selected minor New York Lake Ontario tributaries through the 2014 field year. Included will be the GLRI priority watershed, the Genesee River, and Oak Orchard Creek, both identified as large nutrient loading basins to the southern shore of Lake Ontario. In addition to seven regularly scheduled sampling events for each tributary, the sampling plan will be designed to capture spring, growing season and extreme flow events with a focus on understanding particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations and loadings. This work will be in addition to the work being conducted for template 76 at the Genesee River. This information will be of tremendous value in supporting the development of nutrient loading estimates and for the development of nutrient fate and transport models coincident with the new bi-national Great Lakes Water Quality agreement protocol. Studies of water quality and the lower foodweb at selected nearshore zones impacted by tributary inputs will be designed to better understand the fate and transport of nutrients in the water column and aquatic foodweb and the connection with the health of near-shore aquatic communities and local beaches along the Lake Ontario shoreline. Timing of nearshore sampling events will be coordinated with tributary monitoring. Both tributary and nearshore monitoring and research activities will place an emphasis on developing a better understanding of dissolved and total phosphorus ratios and whether different ratios drive varying biological responses. All of this work will be coordinated with a range of US and Canadian Lake Ontario nutrient related work being conducted in 2013 in order to develop a basin-wide assessment of nutrient loadings, fate and transport and the identification of potential management strategies and research in support of the Lake Ontario Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP). A review of currently on-going, and soon-to-be completed, nutrient-related studies, including fate and transport and the response of biological systems, will be included as part of initial planning workshops and factored into the final near-shore project design. <br /> <br /> Additionally, the Niagara River connecting channel will be monitored starting August 2014 for one year, as a pilot study. Samples will be collected in the channel at Ft. Erie (upstream) and near Niagara-on-the-Lake (downstream) of the connecting channel. A variety of constituents including: nutrients, toxics, emerging contaminants, legacy contaminants, and health-care products, along with flow data will be collected seasonally 3 times a year and 3 times during the summer months based on lake temperature, to capture bioaccumulation effects on these constituents, especially nutrient concentrations. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

Food collection for filter-feeding fishes, such as Silver Carp, is influenced by the species-specific structure of their gill rakers. To investigate structural variation in gill rakers of Silver Carp, the morphology of gill rakers was quantified and compared with that of a native filter-feeding fish species which may compete with Silver Carp for food resources, Gizzard Shad&nbsp;</span><i>Dorosoma cepedianum</i><span>. Intra- and interspecies variation of gill rakers was examined in both species collected from three locations among four months. Interspecies analysis indicated the size of pores in gill rakers of Silver Carp were much larger than the interraker spacings of Gizzard Shad (95% CI ranged from 80.69 to 185.75&nbsp;μm versus 16.72 to 47.36&nbsp;μm, respectively). Intraspecies variation of gill rakers from Silver Carp was related to the overall size of fish and occurred only among sites where dissimilar sizes of fish were collected. This suggested the size of particles filtered by Silver Carp may be dependent upon ontogenic development rather than phenotypic plasticity in response to spatial or temporal factors. Intraspecies variation of gill rakers from Gizzard Shad occurred among site and monthly sampling data; however, variation was only attributable to overall size of fish for monthly sampling data. This suggested ontogeny may influence the filter-feeding ability of this species within a habitat. However, variation noted among sites, which was not attributable to size of fish, may indicate gill rakers are phenotypically plastic among Gizzard Shad populations of various river systems of the upper Mississippi River basin.</span></p>',\n",

New techniques have been developed to survey for species that are difficult to capture with conventional gears that involve the detection of their DNA in water samples (eDNA). This technique is currently used to track the invasion of bigheaded carps (silver carp and bighead carp;&nbsp;<em>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>H. nobilis</em>) in the Chicago Area Waterway System and Upper Mississippi River. In both systems DNA has been detected from silver carp without the capture of a live fish, which has led to some uncertainty about the source of the DNA. The potential contribution to eDNA by vectors and fomites has not been explored. Because barges move from areas with a high abundance of bigheaded carps to areas monitored for the potential presence of silver carp, we used juvenile silver carp to simulate the barge transport of dead bigheaded carp carcasses, slime residue, and predator feces to determine the potential of these sources to supply DNA to uninhabited waters where it could be detected and misinterpreted as indicative of the presence of live bigheaded carp. Our results indicate that all three vectors are feasible sources of detectable eDNA for at least one month after their deposition. This suggests that current monitoring programs must consider alternative vectors of DNA in the environment and consider alternative strategies to minimize the detection of DNA not directly released from live bigheaded carps.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"<h4>Description of Work</h4> The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group's Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Fox River Priority Watershed, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed and edge-of-field scale. The edge-of-field stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter the stream. Relationships between the smaller to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Lower Fox GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored. <br /> &nbsp;\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The first major goal of this project is to characterize and evaluate the extent to which contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) threaten fish and other wildlife in the Great Lakes. This includes identifying and characterizing CECs in the Great Lakes Basin, identifying risk-based screening concentrations for priority CECs, evaluating population-relevant effects of complex mixtures on biota, and identifying the Great Lakes waterways at greatest risk. The second major goal of this project is to pilot and develop a short-term and an ongoing long-term state-of-the-art bioeffects surveillance program for the Great Lakes basin. This includes developing strategies which will account for variable conditions at sampling locations, implementing bioeffects surveillance tools for initial, broad CEC characterization, and demonstrating the application of targeted bioeffects approaches for detailed characterization of status and trends of CECs. A collaboration of federal and academic partners are working together to achieve these objectives.<br> <br> The goals described above will be achieved through three separate, but integrated study components, as shown in the flow diagram below.<br> <br> <img alt=\\\\\"Flow diagram showing the three major components of the project and the flow of work (indicated by arrows) designed to meet the Major Goals of GLRI Action Plan II, Objective 1.2.2.\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://oh.water.usgs.gov/GLRI/project_images/Corsi-673-726_fig1.jpg\\\\\"><br> <br> GLRI Phase II assessments are being conducted at two spatial scales. The Surveillance Program (SP) component is being conducted at the Great Lakes basin-wide scale, and the Integrated Assessment Case Studies (IACS) and Priority Contaminant Mixtures (PCM) components are being conducted at an individual watershed scale.&nbsp; Selected sites include a gradient of land uses at both scales.&nbsp; Sites are also selected based on chemistry and bioactivity data from GLRI Phase I surveys to provide a range of contaminants and ecological impacts.<br> <br> The primary involvement by the USGS is within the SP. The SP was designed to characterize variability of contaminant concentrations and potential biological effects in selected watersheds. Each year, watersheds/tributaries are selected to represent a variety of land uses for that year’s contaminants of focus.&nbsp; Multiple Great Lakes watersheds/tributaries are sampled for water, sediment, and assays for evaluation of potential bioeffects.&nbsp; Seasonal and hydrologic variability is assessed by sampling throughout the year during a variety of streamflow conditions. &nbsp;Temporal variability is also assessed by maintaining a subset of contaminants that are evaluated consistently each year of the project.<br> <br> An extended list of selected classes of chemicals is chosen and monitored each year to collect more in-depth information. Contaminants in the extended list are prioritized based on previous data, known or suspected adverse biological effects, risk-based exceedances (i.e., “concentrations of concern”), and recent CEC research. Contaminant classes that have been chosen to date include pesticides (2016), PAHs (2017) and pharmaceutical/personal care products (2018).&nbsp; Results are compared with aquatic toxicity and other general bioeffect benchmark values to determine potential for adverse biological effects. Analysis on selected samples also includes bioeffects evaluation, including in vivo and high through-put in vitro exposures (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and ToxCast). The bioeffects measurements will include targeted and untargeted analyses, as appropriate to a given watershed/location. Chemical analysis in mussels, fish, and birds are conducted by project partners near SP sampling sites (where practical).<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> The first five years of work on the SP included the establishment of a general monitoring program at 57 sites for a limited number of trace organic chemicals that represented multiple classes of contaminants, a waterborne pathogen investigation at 8 sites, and an investigation of microplastics at 29 sites.<br> <br> Water-quality benchmarks were exceeded at 35% of the 57 sites monitored for trace organic chemicals. The most frequent water-quality benchmark exceedances were from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and detergent metabolites. In addition, comparison to estrogenic equivalency values for those chemicals that have been shown to be endocrine active indicated that there was medium to high risk of estrogenic effects at 18% of sites, with 3 sites having estrogenic equivalents similar to wastewater effluent. Chemicals commonly occurred as complex mixtures of 10 or more. Urban related land-use characteristics were commonly correlated to multiple classes of contaminants.<br> <br> In the waterborne pathogen study, human and bovine viruses were detected in 17% and 18% of samples respectively with viruses occurring more frequently during winter and spring as compared to summer and fall, and more frequently during runoff-events than during low-flow periods. Human viruses occurred most frequently in urban watersheds, while bovine viruses occurred most frequently in agricultural watersheds with substantial dairy operations.<br> <br> In the microplastics study, microplastics were found in all 107 samples collected from 29 tributaries of the Great Lakes, with a maximum concentration of 32 particles/m <sup>3</sup> and a median of 1.9 particles/m <sup>3</sup> -- 94 times greater than the median concentration previously reported for samples from the Great Lakes themselves. Fragments, films, foams, and pellets/beads were positively correlated with urban-related watershed attributes, and were found at greater concentrations during runoff-event conditions. Fibers, the most frequently detected particle type, were not associated with urban-related watershed attributes, wastewater effluent contribution, or hydrologic condition. Results from this study improve our understanding of the sources, transport, and fate of microplastics in freshwater environments, and highlight some of the differences in microplastics types in surface samples from rivers as compared to lakes. <a href=\\\\\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55a9170be4b0183d66e4667e\\\\\">More information is available at the microplastics web site (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55a9170be4b0183d66e4667e).</a><br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> ToxEval: a software package to facilitate screening water chemistry data to estimate the potential for adverse biological effects (currently only available to project participants).<br> <br> A dataset describing the quantity and morphology of floating microplastics in 29 Great Lakes tributaries in 6 states is located here: <a href=\\\\\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5748a29be4b07e28b664dd62\\\\\">https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5748a29be4b07e28b664dd62</a>.

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled \\\\\"Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan\\\\\". This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of three-dimensional point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach near Chicago, Illinois, on September 22, 2016. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using a YSI EcoMapper autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a YSI 6600 V2-4 bulkhead housing a YSI 6560FR fast response temperature/conductivity probe, YSI 6589FR fast response pH sensor, YSI 6150 ROX optical dissolved oxygen sensor, YSI 6136 turbidity sensor, YSI 6025 chlorophyll sensor, and YSI 6131 BGA-PC phycocyanin (blue-green algae) sensor. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the AUV completed the pre-programmed survey pattern of the nearshore zone. The AUV was programmed to continually undulate between the water surface and 4 feet above the bottom (dive angle of 15 degrees) as it moved at 2 knots between programmed waypoints along it survey mission path. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Hydrologic data and groundwater flow simulations in the vicinity of Long Lake, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, near Gary, Indiana',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected data and simulated groundwater flow to increase understanding of the hydrology and the effects of drainage alterations to the water table in the vicinity of Long Lake, near Gary, Indiana. East Long Lake and West Long Lake (collectively known as Long Lake) make up one of the largest interdunal lakes within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The National Park Service is tasked with preservation and restoration of wetlands in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore along the southern shoreline of Lake Michigan. Urban development and engineering have modified drainage and caused changes in the distribution of open water, streams and ditches, and groundwater abundance and flow paths. A better understanding of the effects these modifications have on the hydrologic system in the area will help the National Park Service, the Gary Sanitary District (GSD), and local stakeholders manage and protect the resources within the study area.</p><p>This study used hydrologic data and steady-state groundwater simulations to estimate directions of groundwater flow and the effects of various engineering controls and climatic conditions on the hydrology near Long Lake. Periods of relatively high and low groundwater levels were examined and simulated by using MODFLOW and companion software. Simulated hydrologic modifications examined the effects of (1) removing the beaver dams in US-12 ditch, (2) discontinuing seepage of water from the filtration pond east of East Long Lake, (3) discontinuing discharge from US-12 ditch to the GSD sewer system, (4) decreasing discharge from US-12 ditch to the GSD sewer system, (5) connecting East Long Lake and West Long Lake, (6) deepening County Line Road ditch, and (7) raising and lowering the water level of Lake Michigan.</p><p>Results from collected hydrologic data indicate that East Long Lake functioned as an area of groundwater recharge during October 2002 and a “flow-through” lake during March 2011, with the groundwater divide south of US-12. Wetlands to the south of West Long Lake act as points of recharge to the surficial aquifer in both dry- and wet-weather conditions.</p><p>Among the noteworthy results from a dry-weather groundwater flow model simulation are (1) US-12 ditch does not receive water from East Long Lake or West Long Lake, (2) the filtration pond at the east end of East Long Lake, when active, contributed approximately 10 percent of the total water entering East Long Lake, and (3) County Line Road ditch has little effect on simulated water level.</p><p>Among the noteworthy results from a wet-weather groundwater flow simulation are (1) US-12 ditch does not receive water from East Long Lake or West Long Lake, (2) when the seepage from the filtration pond to the surficial aquifer is not active, sources of inflow to East Long Lake are restricted to only precipitation (46 percent of total) and inflow from the surficial aquifer (54 percent of total), and (3) County Line Road ditch bisects the groundwater divide and creates two water-table mounds south of US-12.</p><p>The results from a series of model scenarios simulating certain engineering controls and changes in Lake Michigan levels include the following: (1) The simulated removal of beaver dams in US-12 ditch during a wet-weather simulation increased discharge from the ditch to the Gary Sanitary system by 13 percent. (2) Discontinuation of seepage from the filtration pond east of East Long Lake decreased discharge from US-12 ditch to the Gary Sanitary system by 2.3 percent. (3) Simulated discontinuation of discharge from the US-12 ditch to the GSD sewer system increased the area where the water table was estimated to be above the land surface beyond the inundated area in the initial wet-weather simulation. (4) Simulated modifications to the control structure at the discharge point of US-12 ditch to the GSD sewer system can decrease discharge by as much as 61 percent while increasing the simulated inundated area during dry weather and decrease discharge as much as 6 percent while increasing the simulated inundated area during wet weather. (5) Deepening of County Line Road ditch can decrease the discharge from US-12 ditch by 26 percent during dry weather and 24 percent during wet weather, as well as decrease the extent of flooded areas south and east of the filtration pond near Ogden Dunes. (7) The increase of the Lake Michigan water level to match the historical maximum can increase the discharge from US-12 ditch by 14 percent during dry weather and by 9.6 percent during wet weather. (8) The decrease of the Lake Michigan water level to match the historical minimum can decrease the discharge from US-12 ditch by 7.4 percent during dry weather and by 3.1 percent during wet weather.</p><p>The results of this study can be used by water-resource managers to understand how surrounding ditches affect water levels in East and West Long Lake and in the surrounding wetlands and residential areas. The groundwater model developed in this study can be applied in the future to answer questions about how alterations to the drainage system in the area will affect water levels in East and West Long Lake and surrounding areas. The modeling methods developed in this study provide a template for other studies of groundwater flow and groundwater/surface-water interactions within the shallow surficial aquifer in northern Indiana, and in similar hydrologic settings that include surficial sand aquifers in coastal settings.</p>',\n",

       "  'title': 'Benthic Communities and Sediment and Water Toxicity in the Rochester Embayment AOC',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The study will be implemented in two phases due to logistical constraints and the need to incorporate methods developed (and findings) from a comparable investigation underway in another AOC. The first phase will consist of site selection, methods refinement, work-plan development, subcontract assembly, site reconnaissance, and sediment collection which will be done mainly during FY2013. The second phase will consist of macroinvertebrate identification, sediment toxicity testing, data analysis and interpretation, and report preparation and review mainly during FY2014. In brief, we will generate bed sediment toxicity and benthic community data needed to test two related hypotheses that address the two criteria for delisting the benthos BUI. The first hypothesis is that bed sediments at selected sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to the test species than bed sediments collected from reference (control) sites located outside the AOC. Acute (survival) and chronic (growth) whole bed-sediment toxicity tests will be conducted using the midge (Chironomus dilutus), following standard methods (USEPA 1994; USEPA 2000). The second hypothesis is that the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from targeted sites within the AOC are not significantly different, or are affected (impacted) no more seriously than the communities encountered at reference sites located outside the AOC according to spatial patterns in benthic community composition (nonparametric ordination) and the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) index and component metrics for Ponar samples collected from soft bed sediments (fig. 1) developed by NY State Department of Environmental Conservation (Bode et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2009). The component metrics of the BAP include: SPP (species richness), HBI (Hilsenhoff Biotic Index), DOM3 (Dominance-3), PMA (Percent Model Affinity), and DIV (species diversity). The mean score of the five indices denotes the overall BAP and associated impact for each site. Although several bed sediment-collection methods are suitable, the Petite Ponar sampler will be used to collect 5 replicate macroinvertebrate-community samples and a single composite sample for bed sediment toxicity tests at each study site. Bed-sediment sizes will be characterized by either the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sediment Laboratory or NYSDEC subcontract laboratory using a subsample (split) obtained from the composite bed sediment-toxicity sample. Statistical analyses and multivariate (ordination) methods will be used to test the two hypotheses and to determine if the bed sediments within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet either criterion for delisting the benthos BUI. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Characterization of diel variability of fecal indicator bacteria concentration in nearshore waters is of particular importance for development of water sampling standards and protection of public health. Significant nighttime increase in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) concentration in beach water, previously observed at marine sites, has also been identified in summer 2000 from fixed locations in waist- and knee-deep waters at Chicago 63rd Street Beach, an embayed, tideless, freshwater beach with low currents at night (approximately 0.015 m s<sup>–1</sup>). A theoretical model using wave-induced mass transport velocity for advection was developed to assess the contribution of surface waves to the observed nighttime <i>E. coli</i> replenishment in the nearshore water. Using average wave conditions for the summer season of year 2000, the model predicted an amount of <i>E. coli</i> transported from water of intermediate depth, where sediment resuspension occurred intermittently, that would be sufficient to have elevated <i>E. coli</i> concentration in the surf and swash zones as observed. The nighttime replenishment of <i>E. coli</i> in the surf and swash zones revealed here is an important phase in the cycle of diel variations of <i>E. coli</i> concentration in nearshore water. According to previous findings in Ge et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2010, 44, 6731–6737), enhanced current circulation in the embayment during the day tends to displace and deposit material offshore, which partially sets up the system by the early evening for a new period of nighttime onshore movement. This wave-induced mass transport effect, although facilitating a significant base supply of material shoreward, can be perturbed or significantly influenced by high currents (orders of magnitude larger than a typical wave-induced mass transport velocity), current-induced turbulence, and tidal forcing.',\n",

If additional funding is available in FY14, two additional chemicals will be tested. Selection of the three organic chemicals to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature, on the results of ongoing acute toxicity testing of mussels and snails at USGS-Columbia with up to 20 chemicals of concern, and on consultations with USEPA Region 5. Candidate organic chemicals might include pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

Analysis of more than 440\\u2009000 quality-filtered sequences obtained from the foregut and hindgut of GZSD and SVCP revealed high microbial diversity in these samples. GZSD hindgut (GZSD_H) samples (n=23) with &gt;7000 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) exhibited the highest alpha-diversity indices followed by SVCP foregut (n=15), GZSD foregut (n=9) and SVCP hindgut (SVCP_H) (n=24). UniFrac distance-based non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed that the microbiota of GZSD_H and SVCP_H were clearly separated into two clusters: samples in the GZSD cluster were observed to vary by sampling location and samples in the SVCP cluster by sampling date. NMDS further revealed distinct microbial community between foregut to hindgut for individual GZSD and SVCP. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were detected as the predominant phyla regardless of fish or gut type. The high abundance of Cyanobacteria observed was possibly supported by their role as the fish’s major food source. Furthermore, unique and shared OTUs and OTUs in each gut type were identified, three OTUs from the order Bacteroidales, the genus Bacillariophyta and the genus Clostridium were found significantly more abundant in GZSD_H (14.9–22.8%) than in SVCP_H (0.13–4.1%) samples. These differences were presumably caused by the differences in the type of food sources including bacteria ingested, the gut morphology and digestion, and the physiological behavior between GZSD and SVCP.',\n",

At Lake Michigan, new invaders (e.g., dreissenid mussels (<em>Dreissena</em> spp.), spiny water flea (<em>Bythotrephes longimanus</em>), round goby (<em>Neogobius melanostomus</em>)) have proliferated and altered energy transfer pathways, while nutrient concentrations and stocking rates to support fisheries have changed.

Simulations predicted biomass reductions across all trophic levels and predicted biomasses fit observed trends for most functional groups. The effects of invasive species (e.g., dreissenid grazing) increased across simulation years, but were difficult to disentangle from other changes (e.g., declining offshore nutrient concentrations).

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Since 2010, connecting channels have been included in each of the Great Lakes’ Lake Management Plans (LaMPs). Lake Ontario now includes both the Niagara River and the St. Lawrence River. The Niagara River is well characterized by a number of long-term programs, but because of the lack of tributary water-quality data, the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries constitute a data gap in the information needed for the Lake Ontario to fulfill its goals. Critical information needs, including basic water-quality parameters, total suspended solids, nutrients and flow data. These data are needed to aid in the identification of sources of nutrient and sediment loading to the St. Lawrence. The monitoring network will consist of seven sites on four rivers (the St. Lawrence and three tributaries: Grass River, Raquette River, and St Regis River), and will include monitoring two locations on the three tributary rivers. In addition, the St. Lawrence River will also be sampled. Four samples will be collected during the first year of monitoring, starting in FY-13. These samples will be scheduled at equal temporal intervals based on beginning date of the project. Comparison of water-quality data from upstream to downstream sites will be useful in assessing the impact of sediment and nutrient sources between these sites. Field, laboratory, and flow parameters will be measured at each site during each visit. Field parameters will be collected at each site and will include pH, temperature, and specific conductance. Samples will be collected and analyzed for Total Suspended Sediment and nutrients: [Ammonia as N, Nitrite, nitrite+nitrate, and Total Nitrogen] and [Orthophosphate (soluble reactive Phosphorous) and Total Phosphorous]. In cases where USGS flow data are not available, flow data will be collected at the site according to USGS protocols. Analytical methods corresponding to those used in the GLRI Lake Ontario tributary sampling being performed by the USGS as part of template 153b in 2012 will be used. One quality assurance sample will be collected per round of sampling; a total of two blanks and two replicates will be collected over the four sampling rounds. Analytical data results will be reported to the EPA using spreadsheets and will also be available through the USGS National Water Quality Information (NWIS) site for the public. These data will be provided within three months of the end of sample collection. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The sensitivity of listed species of fish or amphibians was evaluated in acute and chronic toxicity tests conducted with a range of inorganic or organic chemicals with different toxic modes of action. Results of these studies indicate that the acute or chronic sensitivity of rainbow trout, but not fathead minnow, frequently provided protective acute or chronic toxicity thresholds for most of the listed species evaluated. However, only a limited number of species of sculpins or darters were included in this evaluation, and not all species tested occurred in the Great Lakes watershed. The objective of the proposed study will be to: (1) provide additional chronic toxicity data for sculpins or darters indigenous to the Great Lakes to complement the limited chronic toxicity data for pentachlorophenol (PCP) or copper previously reported for darters or for sculpins and (2) provide acute toxicity data for additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnow. USGS-Columbia will conduct: (1) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with PCP and mottled sculpins, (2) acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with fathead minnows (repeating the Besser et al. 2005 study). If additional funding is provided in FY14, USGS Columbia will conduct acute 4-d and chronic 28-d toxicity tests with copper and PCP with an additional darter species of concern in the Great Lakes. The combined results of the previous and new studies would include 4-d acute and 28-d chronic toxicity data sets for PCP and copper for the following species: rainbow trout, fathead minnow (2X), mottled sculpin, fountain darter, and one additional species of darter from the Great Lakes watershed. Acute toxicity tests will also be conducted with up to about six additional chemicals of concern with sculpins, darters, rainbow trout, and fathead minnows. The number of chemicals tested and the number of species of sculpins or darters tested will be dependent on the availability of early life stages of sculpins or darters. Other taxa might be considered if newly hatched young of the desired species of sculpin or darters cannot be obtained. Selection of the species to be tested will be decided based on a review of the literature and on consultations with USEPA Region 5. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill)) are important commercially, culturally, and ecologically in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Stocks of lake whitefish in the Great Lakes have recovered from low levels of abundance in the 1960s. Reductions in abundance, loss of habitat and environmental degradation can be accompanied by losses of genetic diversity and overall fitness that may persist even as populations recover demographically. Therefore, it is important to be able to identify stocks that have reduced levels of genetic diversity. In this study, we investigated patterns of genetic diversity at microsatellite DNA loci in lake whitefish collected between 1927 and 1929 (historical period) and between 1997 and 2005 (contemporary period) from Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Genetic analysis of lake whitefish from Lakes Huron and Erie shows that the amount of population structuring varies from lake to lake. Greater genetic divergences among collections from Lake Huron may be the result of sampling scale, migration patterns and demographic processes. Fluctuations in abundance of lake whitefish populations may have resulted in periods of increased genetic drift that have resulted in changes in allele frequencies over time, but periodic genetic drift was not severe enough to result in a significant loss of genetic diversity. Migration among stocks may have decreased levels of genetic differentiation while not completely obscuring stock boundaries. Recent changes in spatial boundaries to stocks, the number of stocks and life history characteristics of stocks further demonstrate the potential of coregonids for a swift and varied response to environmental change and emphasise the importance of incorporating both spatial and temporal considerations into management plans to ensure that diversity is preserved.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Microbial source tracking assays to identify sources of waterborne contamination typically target genetic markers of host-specific microorganisms. However, no bacterial marker has been shown to be 100% host-specific, and cross-reactivity has been noted in studies evaluating known source samples. Using 485 challenge samples from 20 different human and animal fecal sources, this study evaluated microbial source tracking markers including the Bacteroides HF183 16S rRNA, M. smithii nifH, and Enterococcus esp gene targets that have been proposed as potential indicators of human fecal contamination. Bayes' Theorem was used to calculate the conditional probability that these markers or a combination of markers can correctly identify human sources of fecal pollution. All three human-associated markers were detected in 100% of the sewage samples analyzed. Bacteroides HF183 was the most effective marker for determining whether contamination was specifically from a human source, and greater than 98% certainty that contamination was from a human source was shown when both Bacteroides HF183 and M. smithii nifH markers were present. A high degree of certainty was attained even in cases where the prior probability of human fecal contamination was as low as 8.5%. The combination of Bacteroides HF183 and M. smithii nifH source tracking markers can help identify surface waters impacted by human fecal contamination, information useful for prioritizing restoration activities or assessing health risks from exposure to contaminated waters.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will expand the online availability of geospatial data to monitor the presence and extent of invasive species in wetlands, coastal areas and other sensitive habitats. USGS is working with the Great Lakes Observing System collaboration and other data sharing efforts across the Great Lakes to compile the data into a user friendly format that is accessible on line. Elevation data will be expanded in the Great Lakes Basin using a collaborative to support the GLRI. This information would support invasive species monitoring, wetland inventory, and habitat restoration. USGS will work with the Great Lakes Observing System and other data sharing efforts to make USGS geospatial information readily accessible to researchers and the public. Working with county governments, the State of Michigan, and other Federal Agencies, particularly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey will endeavor to acquire high-resolution elevation and LiDAR point-cloud data for (in order of priority): Macomb County, St. Clair County, and Monroe County, Michigan. Data will be acquired based on a standard USGS specification requiring 2 meter maximum sample spacing, 15cm maximum vertical error, as well as several interpreted products. The contract will be handled by the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC) Commercial Partnerships Team (CPT) based in Rolla Missouri. The NGTOC will be reimbursed at a rate of between 5 and 10% for labor associated with contract management, administration, and QA/QC of the products. The rapidly deteriorating budget situation for local governments in Southeast Michigan has called into question the availability of local matching funds. In the absence of local matching funds, data sharing agreements will be negotiated with the counties to make locally maintained geospatial data available to scientists and the general public. Priority will be given first to HEC counties, then counties contributing to the HEC, and finally other counties in the Lake Erie Basin that have not been flown.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4> Complete LiDAR coverage for the Huron-Erie Corridor. Depending on funds actually available or obtained through partnerships, expand to finish the Lake Erie watershed. Make all of this data available to scientists, managers, State/County/Local agencies, and the general public.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> LiDAR is a critical data need for many Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as environmental managers and researchers. Much of the elevation data in the Great Lakes, and within the western Lake Erie watershed, is more than 30 years old. In regions of modest relief, such as the lake plains of Monroe and Macomb County, MI, the existing 30m DEM and 10ft contours are both outdated and lack sufficient detail to identify areas of current or potential wetlands, develop restoration and management plans, or even delineate watersheds reliably. Further, the additional derivative products of the LiDAR, including land cover, canopy height, and biomass, among others, provide useful information for restoration.<br> <br> Large, consolidated purchases through established contract vehicles minimizes the data cost per unit area, while assuring a high level of standardization and compatibility. The USGS has been a leader in this field for two decades, and has ongoing relationships with partners flying areas ranging in size from individual counties to the state of Iowa.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Approach</h4> Working with county governments, the State of Michigan, and other Federal Agencies, particularly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey will endeavor to acquire high-resolution elevation and LiDAR point-cloud data for (in order of priority): Macomb County, St. Clair County, and Monroe County, Michigan.

If so, this will allow better coverage of the 2nd and 3rd priority areas.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> In terms of planning and managing the project, communications will be primarily between USGS Liaisons and county partners, or Federal partners.<br> <br> The Federal collaborators on the 2011 remote sensing plan have developed a white paper for GLNPO. This white paper has been provided for review and comment, and will likely be revised to address concerns or comments GLNPO may have. The intent of that document is explain both the GLNPO and to watchdog groups the different remote sensing technologies being employed in several templates, and express how these various efforts complement each other, rather than compete.<br> <br> A fact sheet will be developed in conjunction with the EROS Data Center based on data for Wayne Co, MI (about to be delivered 12/2009) illustrating the improvements possible in watershed delineation, hydrologic routing, and land cover classification based on LiDAR, as well as examples of several additional analyses, such as cut-fill, canopy closure, and biomass estimates.<br> <br> Following production of the data, in conjunction with partnering local and regional agencies, we can do a press release and a demonstration of identifying a wetland based on the LiDAR and imagery (from a separate funding source) we will be partnering on in the Detroit area. The biggest opportunity may not be until 2011, when new topographic maps will be produced with the new data.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'title': 'Targeted Delivery of Control Agents to Bigheaded Carps',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Studies assessing seasonal and spatial changes in digestive enzymes and gill raker morphology in bigheaded carps and native planktivorous fishes have been completed. Results indicate that bigheaded carps feed earlier in the year than native filter-feeding fishes and that certain digestive enzymes present in bigheaded carps are either not present in some native fishes or are much less active in the native species than in bigheaded carps. Results also indicate that the gill raker morphology of bigheaded carps is relatively constant with minimal seasonally or spatially relevant changes unlike that of the native gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) which had both seasonal and spatially correlated changes in gill raker morphology. These data are currently being used to inform the development of microparticle formulations to target control agent uptake by and release in bigheaded carps.<br> <br> Studies are in progress to assess control agent availability/uptake from microparticles by bigheaded carps and native fishes. Work is also proceeding to determine the buoyancy of microparticles (i.e., do they sink, suspend or float when placed in water) and whether the control agent leaches from the microparticle. Studies are also in progress to assess the palatability of microparticle formulations to bigheaded carps (i.e., will bigheaded carps consume the microparticles). Only those microparticle formulations with minimal to no leaching, that are neutral to positively buoyant and are readily accepted by both bighead carp and silver carp will be used in further studies. Several microparticle formulations met these acceptance criteria and initial controlled, laboratory trials are in progress in the specially designed Invasive Species Complex at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, La Crosse, WI. In these trials, bigheaded carps and native fish are being offered microparticle formulations containing an EPA-registered piscicide. As the trials proceed, microparticle formulations will be modified as needed to enhance acceptance of the control agent-laden microparticles by bigheaded carps and minimize their uptake by native fish.<br> <br> Development of these control agent-laden microparticles is a complex process that will include assessments of the risk of non-target animal exposure (e.g., native fishes and aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial animals that might consume fish that have consumed the microparticles, etc.,), degradation characteristics of the microparticles (i.e., how long will the microparticle and control agent persist), and other data needed to obtain registration of these control agent and microparticle formulations. Using an EPA-registered control agent for microparticle formulations is a benefit because data already exist for the control agent registration –data development will focus on how incorporating the control agent within the microparticle changes risks associated with exposure to that control agent.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Developing a control agent-laden microparticle could provide natural resource managers with the potential to target control efforts of bigheaded carps within selected habitats while minimizing the impacts to native species. Applied in conjunction with the feeding stimulants being developed by USGS scientists, managers could target delivery of control agent-laden microparticle within locations where bigheaded carp congregate to feed, minimizing the area where the microparticles are applied and limiting potential effects on native species. Applied within an integrated pest management framework, the development of these control agent-laden microparticles could substantially enhance the tools available to managers to control or limit populations of bigheaded carps. Although initial formulations focus on incorporating lethal chemical control agents, future formulations could incorporate biological or chemical agents which may have lethal to non-lethal effects.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>The size of the pores in silver carp gill rakers varied with fish size but not spatially or temporally whereas gill raker spacing in gizzard shad suggested phenotypic plasticity as the spacing varied seasonally and spatially.</li> <li>Bigheaded carps offered a range of sizes of microparticles containing a non-toxic dye readily consumed the microparticles and appeared to prefer microparticles ranging in size from 50 to 100 µm.</li> <li>Targeting a microparticle size range of 50 to 100 µm limits the number of non-target fish species that retain this particle size as food but there is overlap with some common species (e.g. gizzard shad).</li> <li>Bigheaded carps continue to feed at water temperatures below those at which native filter-feeding fish feed.</li> <li>Bigheaded carps have similar feed capacities when held at 12 or 24°C, but have the greatest capacity at 18°C</li> <li>The gastric evacuation rate of bigheaded carps is temperature dependent and slower at 12°C than at 24°C.</li> <li>Trypsin and phosphatases (digestive enzymes) are present in greater quantities and are more active in bigheaded carps than in native filter-feeding fishes.</li> </ul>',\n",

This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of three-dimensional point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach near Chicago, Illinois, on September 2, 2015. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using a YSI EcoMapper autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a YSI 6600 V2-4 bulkhead housing a YSI 6560FR fast response temperature/conductivity probe, YSI 6589FR fast response pH sensor, YSI 6150 ROX optical dissolved oxygen sensor, YSI 6136 turbidity sensor, YSI 6025 chlorophyll sensor, and YSI 6131 BGA-PC phycocyanin (blue-green algae) sensor. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the AUV completed the pre-programmed survey pattern of the nearshore zone. The AUV was programmed to continually undulate between the water surface and 4 feet above the bottom (dive angle of 15 degrees) as it moved at 2 knots between programmed waypoints along it survey mission path. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The geology, hydrology, sediment, and water quality of the Des Plaines River, I&amp;M Canal, and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and the aquifer between these water bodies were characterized along a 19-mile reach of interest. Acoustic data and a field examination of the bedrock identified the geometry of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and areas with fractures that could possibly transport water from the Des Plaines River or I&amp;M Canal to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal by way of the groundwater system. The areas with fractures were further investigated by collecting sediment, geologic, and hydraulic data that could indicate a connection between the surface-water bodies and the groundwater. Water-level and water-quality were collected from wells, the Des Plaines River, and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal for several months to determine how the water moved through the area over a range of hydraulic conditions. The final test to assess the connections between these water bodies was completed by injecting dye into the Des Plaines River and tracking it to see if it traveled through the groundwater into the observation wells or into Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> This project helps to understand the risk of Asian carp moving from the Mississippi River basin to the Great Lakes basin through the groundwater connections near Lemont, Illinois.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>Detailed geologic, hydraulic, and water-quality data (including tracer concentrations) obtained from monitoring wells, in combination with detailed hydraulic and water-quality data from the river and canal, indicate that interbasin transfer of Asian carps from the Des Plaines River to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal by way of migration through groundwater is unlikely.</li> <li>There does not appear to be an interconnected network of secondary-permeability features large enough to transport Asian carp eggs in the study area.</li> <li>Groundwater velocities, and groundwater quality in at least some parts of the study area, are not conducive to the eggs being able to survive movement through fractures.</li> </ul> <h4>Products</h4> Kay, R.T., Mills, P.C., and Jackson, P.R., 2016, Geology, hydrology, water quality, and potential for interbasin invasive-species spread by way of the groundwater pathway near Lemont, Illinois: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2016–5095, 91 p. <a href=\\\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/\\\\\">http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/</a><br> <br> Jackson, P.R., 2016, Acoustic Doppler current profiler velocity data collected in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in 2010 and 2011 in support of the interbasin transport study for invasive Asian carp: U.S. Geological Survey data release, <a href=\\\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7S180KR\\\\\">http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7S180KR</a>.<br> <br> Jackson, P.R., 2016, Water-quality distribution in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, USGS towed multiparameter sonde, Daily tow data files (Feb. 25-27, 2010 and March 2-3, 2010): U.S. Geological Survey data release, <a href=\\\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7N877WG\\\\\">http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7N877WG</a>.<br> <br> Jackson, P.R., 2016, Spatial distribution of Rhodamine WT dye concentration measured in the Des Plaines River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Chicago, IL in November 2011: U.S. Geological Survey data release, <a href=\\\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7HH6H55\\\\\">http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7HH6H55</a>.',\n",

       "  'title': 'A conceptual framework for Lake Michigan coastal/nearshore ecosystems, with application to Lake Michigan Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP) objectives',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The Lakewide Management Plans (LaMPs) within the Great Lakes region are examples of broad-scale, collaborative resource-management efforts that require a sound ecosystems approach. Yet, the LaMP process is lacking a holistic framework that allows these individual actions to be planned and understood within the broader context of the Great Lakes ecosystem. In this paper we (1) introduce a conceptual framework that unifies ideas and language among Great Lakes managers and scientists, whose focus areas range from tributary watersheds to open-lake waters, and (2) illustrate how the framework can be used to outline the geomorphic, hydrologic biological, and societal processes that underlie several goals of the Lake Michigan LaMP, thus providing a holistic and fairly comprehensive roadmap for tackling these challenges. For each selected goal, we developed a matrix that identifies the key ecosystem processes within the cell for each lake zone and each discipline; we then provide one example where a process is poorly understood and a second where a process is understood, but its impact or importance is unclear. Implicit in these objectives was our intention to highlight the importance of the Great Lakes coastal/nearshore zone. Although the coastal/nearshore zone is the important linkage zone between the watershed and open-lake zones—and is the zone where most LaMP issues are focused--scientists and managers have a relatively poor understanding of how the coastal/nearshore zone functions. We envision follow-up steps including (1) collaborative development of a more detailed and more complete conceptual model of how (and where) identified processes are thought to function, and (2) a subsequent gap analysis of science and monitoring priorities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Water Availability Tool for Environmental Resources (WATER) was developed in cooperation with the Kentucky Division of Water to provide a consistent and defensible method of estimating streamflow and water availability in ungaged basins. WATER is process oriented; it is based on the TOPMODEL code and incorporates historical water-use data together with physiographic data that quantitatively describe topography and soil-water storage. The result is a user-friendly decision tool that can estimate water availability in non-karst areas of Kentucky without additional data or processing. The model runs on a daily time step, and critical source data include a historical record of daily temperature and precipitation, digital elevation models (DEMs), the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and historical records of water discharges and withdrawals. The model was calibrated and statistically evaluated for 12 basins by comparing the estimated discharge to that observed at U.S. Geological Survey streamflow-gaging stations. When statistically evaluated over a 2,119-day time period, the discharge estimates showed a bias of -0.29 to 0.42, a root mean square error of 1.66 to 5.06, a correlation of 0.54 to 0.85, and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.26 to 0.72. The parameter and input modifications that most significantly improved the accuracy and precision of streamflow-discharge estimates were the addition of Next Generation radar (NEXRAD) precipitation data, a rooting depth of 30 centimeters, and a TOPMODEL scaling parameter (m) derived directly from SSURGO data that was multiplied by an adjustment factor of 0.10. No site-specific optimization was used.',\n",

In 2010 and 2012, 1244 total carcasses (0.8 dead bird/km walked) and 2399 total carcasses (1.2 dead birds/km walked), respectively, were detected. Fewer carcasses were detected in 2011 (353 total carcasses, 0.2 dead bird/km walked) and 2013 (451 total carcasses, 0.3 dead bird/km walked). During 3&nbsp;years, peak detection of carcasses occurred in October and involved primarily migratory diving and fish-eating birds, including long-tailed ducks (</span><i>Clangula hyemalis</i><span>; 2010), common loons (</span><i>Gavia immer</i><span>; 2012), and red-breasted mergansers (</span><i>Mergus serrator</i><span>; 2013). In 2011, peak detection of carcasses occurred in August and consisted primarily of summer residents such as gulls (</span><i>Larus</i><span>&nbsp;spp.) and double-crested cormorants (</span><i>Phalacrocorax auritus</i><span>). A subset of fresh carcasses was collected throughout each year of the study and tested for botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E). Sixty-one percent of carcasses (57/94) and 10 of 11 species collected throughout the sampling season tested positive for BoNT/E, suggesting avian botulism type E was a major cause of death for both resident and migratory birds in Lake Michigan. The variety of avian species affected by botulism type E throughout the summer and fall during all 4&nbsp;years of coordinated surveillance also suggests multiple routes for bird exposure to BoNT/E in Lake Michigan.</span></p>',\n",

This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> This work began by assembling fish toxicant data into a common database and examining the database for trends in toxicant data. The trends found in the toxicant database were linked to physiochemical properties of the individual toxicants. Combining the toxicant trends with the physiochemical properties may allow for the prediction of toxicity and the identification of chemicals with selectivity for the Asian carp. Identifying a selective toxicant may provide control of Asian carps while minimizing effects on other non-target aquatic species. When Asian carp specific toxicants are identified from the initial screen within the database these toxicants are then further screened in toxicity assays using fish cell lines developed in an earlier phase of this project. The use of fish cell lines as an initial screening tool provides a rapid and inexpensive method of assessment. It also minimizes the number of fish required for laboratory experiments during the development of new toxicants. The toxicants which have the best selectivity for Asian carp, as determined by fish cell line response, will complete additional screenings and evaluation to determine if they are viable candidates for registration as a new fish toxicant.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The benefits of using fish cell lines as a screening paradigm for selecting new candidate toxicants is three-fold. First, time is saved due to the fact that no fish broods are required to reach an age/weight needed to test chemical in a laboratory tank test system. Screening dozens or even a few hundred potential toxicants would take extensive time to cultivate the number of fish required from multiple species. Furthermore, the tests themselves generally require up to a week to complete and are therefore labor intensive. Although screening of toxicants with live fish will still be necessary, the initial and secondary screens with the toxicant database and the fish cell lines will minimize the number of live fish tests required. Second, fish cell lines are much cheaper to maintain than live fish. No large quantities of water are required with the incorporated cost of preparing, holding, and discharging the used water contaminated with the toxicant tested. The cost of maintaining the fish cell lines is also well below the cost of cultivating tanks of numerous fish species. Also, toxicants that are tested can be expensive and using fish cell lines will minimize the costs associated with the testing of expensive chemicals. Furthermore, fish cell lines are immediately available to test any range of chemicals on multiple fish species. Finally, minimizing the total number of animals used in any test program is ethically preferred and even mandated in many European countries.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> The links between the physiochemical properties and toxicant trends have been developed and are ready to apply to chemical databases to identify potential fish species-specific toxicants.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> Bighead and silver carp gill, skin, and fry cell lines<br> <br> Database of physiochemical properties and toxic effect of specific toxicants on invasive and indigenous fish species at <a href=\\\\\"http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/aquatic/toxicity/toxicity.html\\\\\">http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/aquatic/toxicity/toxicity.html</a>.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding of factors that influence Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT) concentrations, pathogen occurrence, and microbial sources at Great Lakes beaches comes largely from individual beach studies. Using 12 representative beaches, we tested enrichment cultures from 273 beach water and 22 tributary samples for EC, ENT, and genes indicating the bacterial pathogens Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), Shigella spp., Salmonella spp, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 108–145 samples for Bacteroides human, ruminant, and gull source-marker genes. EC/ENT temporal patterns, general Bacteroides concentration, and pathogen types and occurrence were regionally consistent (up to 40 km), but beach catchment variables (drains/creeks, impervious surface, urban land cover) influenced exceedances of EC/ENT standards and detections of Salmonella and STEC. Pathogen detections were more numerous when the EC/ENT Beach Action Value (but not when the Geometric Mean and Statistical Threshold Value) was exceeded. EC, ENT, and pathogens were not necessarily influenced by the same variables. Multiple Bacteroides sources, varying by date, occurred at every beach. Study of multiple beaches in different geographic settings provided new insights on the contrasting influences of regional and local variables, and a broader-scale perspective, on significance of EC/ENT exceedances, bacterial sources, and pathogen occurrence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Eggs of silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix absorb water after release from the female, causing them to become turgid and to increase substantially in size. The volume of water that diffuses within an egg is most likely determined by (1) the difference in ionic concentration between the egg and the water that surrounds it and (2) the elasticity of the egg membrane. Prior observations suggest that silver carp eggs may swell and burst in soft waters. If water hardness affects silver carp reproductive success in nonnative ecosystems, this abiotic factor could limit silver carp distribution or abundance. In this study, we tested the effect of water hardness on silver carp egg enlargement and hatching success. Groups of newly fertilized silver carp eggs were placed in water at one of five nominal water hardness levels (50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>) for 1 h to harden (absorb water after fertilization). Egg groups were then placed in separate incubation vessels housed in two recirculation systems that were supplied with either soft (50 mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or hard (250 mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>) water to evaluate hatching success. Tests were terminated within 24 h after viable eggs had hatched. Eggs that were initially placed in 50-mg/L water to harden were larger (i.e., swelled more) and had a greater probability of hatch than eggs hardened in other water hardness levels. Unlike the effect of water hardness during egg hardening, the water hardness during incubation appeared to have no effect on egg hatching success. Our research suggests that water hardness may not be a limiting factor in the reproduction, recruitment, and range expansion of silver carp in North America.',\n",

Egg size was related to temperature and maternal size, with the largest eggs coming from the largest females, and eggs were generally larger in warmer treatments. Young grass carp larvae exhibited upward and downward swimming interspersed with long periods of lying on the bottom. Swimming capacity increased with ontogeny, and larvae were capable of horizontal swimming and position holding with gas bladder emergence.

       "  'abstract': \"<h4>Description of Work</h4>The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Four Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group's Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, Maumee, and Genesee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed, edge-of-field, and subsurface-tile scale where monitoring locations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter receiving streams. Relationships between the small to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is ongoing. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored.<h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4>The GLRI Priority Watershed project has two primary objectives: 1) Reducing nutrients, primarily phosphorus, in agricultural runoff from the four GLRI Priority Watersheds. 2) Monitoring and modeling the phosphorus-reduction effectiveness of agricultural conservation practices. This monitoring and modeling effort directly address the measures of progress listed in the GLRI Action Plan II and provides beneficial data and products that help other partnering agencies accomplish their activities, allowing a more adaptive approach to both the monitoring and the conservation goals of GLRI. USGS scientists work closely with NRCS staff to identify the sources of phosphorus and other nutrients, and to quantify runoff water quality before and after conservation practices are installed. The data collected are also used to predict potential phosphorus reductions on a broader watershed scale. Rapid sharing of project results with local watershed stakeholders informs adaptive implementation of conservation practices and encourages producer communication.<h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4>This monitoring and modeling effort directly address the measures of progress listed in the GLRI Action Plan II and provides beneficial data and products that help other partnering agencies accomplish their activities, allowing a more adaptive approach to both the monitoring and the conservation goals of GLRI. This effort will evaluate USDA conservation-practice effectiveness, utilize that data to support the modeling component to forecast water-quality improvements, and provide relevant information to partnering agencies to meet overall program goal. This effort can help agencies and stakeholders start adaptation and implementation plans.<h4>Products</h4>USGS Reports describing results from each site, and a Journal Article describing the overall results from the program.

The USGS uses a nested-basin design where both individual field runoff and larger subbasin streams are monitored. By monitoring at multiple scales, both the immediate effect of a conservation practice on a single field and the cumulative effect on the larger watershed can be evaluated. This project utilized partnership building and monitoring strategies that provide an avenue of cross-sharing of information between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as producers and producer groups.<h4>Key Findings</h4>nitial GLRI EOF monitoring data are providing a wide range of benefits: Identification of periods and conditions when runoff is likely (such as frozen vs. unfrozen ground) Examination of magnitude, distribution, and factors affecting sediment and nutrient losses during runoff events Providing data for model calibration and validation Education and outreach Comparison to previous EOF monitoring study findings Evaluations of conservation-practice effectiveness using the monitoring data should be available by the end of the GLRI Action Plan II in 2019. In advance of those results, the modeling component will help forecast water-quality improvements based on the in-progress monitoring data. This effort can help agencies and stakeholders start adaptation and implementation plans.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The main objective of this project is to identify locations within the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers that provide the best opportunities for remediation of fish spawning and nursery habitats, with the ultimate goal of enhancing native fish populations. Information about existing river habitat, current patterns, fish nursery areas, movements, spawning, and early life habitat requirements are being used in adaptive management models to identify areas suitable for creation or restoration of fish habitats. Physical and biological information are being coupled to show where and how habitat restoration will produce the strongest benefits to native fishes at multiple locations in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. This project also addresses AOC delisting goals in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers by mapping current areas of fish habitat, identifying sites for habitat restoration, and examining connectivity to surrounding habitats.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> This project is remediating some of the effects of development (e.g., shoreline hardening, channelization, infilling of wetlands) over the last century on native fish species and their habitats in the HEC. Scientists are identifying remaining habitat fragments and new areas where habitat restoration could produce self-sustaining populations of native fishes. Information gained from previous research conducted by the USGS Great Lakes Science Center and partners in the Detroit River resulted in the construction of two fish spawning reefs that are used by at least 14 species of native fish, including economically important walleye and lake sturgeon (threatened in Michigan and Ontario). This project builds upon previous work by expanding the spatial scope of restoration to include the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair. Habitat assessment and restoration techniques developed in the HEC through this project could be applied to other Great Lakes connecting channels, such as the St. Marys and Niagara Rivers, and the Welland Canal. To ensure that information generated through this project is accessible by local communities, an outreach partnership with Michigan Sea Grant has been developed. Ultimately, this work will enhance ecologically and economically valuable fish populations in the HEC, and contribute to the revitalization of the region.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The USGS conducted intensive surveys in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers in 2010-2012 to assess the extent of fish spawning and nursery habitat use. Data gathered from these surveys were used in geographic, hydrodynamic models that predicted lake sturgeon, walleye, and lake whitefish spawning areas that would be suitable for spawning reef construction. The USGS continued to measure the extent of fish spawning and abundance of larval fishes in 2012 at more than 20 sites in the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. Ongoing sampling at these sites is providing information on the timing and spatial distribution of fish spawning, fish eggs, and larvae necessary for restoration efforts. Restored habitats are attracting numerous fish, including multiple threatened species, showing proof-of-concept for this science-guided restoration project. Since 2010, nine Northern madtoms have been captured in the Detroit River. Madtoms are endangered in Michigan and Ontario and are considered globally rare. Assessment data have revealed that madtoms use the constructed reefs created in the Detroit River. Additionally, multiple lake sturgeon in spawning condition were collected on restored habitats. The first collection of juvenile lake sturgeon was made in the Detroit River during 2010, suggesting successful spawning of sturgeon on restored habitat. Juvenile lake herring were also collected in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers during 2011 and 2012.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> The USGS, in collaboration with management agency partners, began developing a&nbsp;conservation action plan&nbsp;during 2012 to provide a fine-scale assessment of the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. The conservation action plan will identify knowledge gaps and aid in future monitoring and the prioritization of restoration efforts within the system.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled “Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan”. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of bathymetric soundings in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach at Jackson Park at Hyde Park, Illinois. Water column depths were measured using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz Rio Grande acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted to a U.S. Geological Survey hydrographic survey vessel. The water column depths from the four diverging beams of the ADCP have been corrected for instrument heading, pitch, and roll and georectified using The Velocity Mapping Toolbox (https://hydroacoustics.usgs.gov/movingboat/VMT/VMT.shtml). Geolocation of the beam soundings was possible using a Hemisphere Crescent A100 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted directly above the ADCP. This GPS receiver has sub-meter horizontal accuracy when operated in differential mode. The edited water column depths were transformed to lake bed elevations using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Calumet Harbor Water Level Gage (9087044) which records at 6-minute intervals. This gage is located approximately 4.6 miles south of the survey site. Bed elevations have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a foot.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the invasive form of <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed) poses a threat to highly productive coastal wetlands and shorelines by forming impenetrable stands that outcompete native plants. Large, dominant stands can derail efforts to restore wetland ecosystems degraded by other stressors. To be proactive, landscape-level management of <i>Phragmites</i> requires information on the current spatial distribution of the species and a characterization of areas suitable for future colonization. Using a recent basin-scale map of this invasive plant’s distribution in the U.S. coastal zone of the Great Lakes, environmental data (e.g., soils, nutrients, disturbance, climate, topography), and climate predictions, we performed analyses of current and predicted suitable coastal habitat using boosted regression trees, a type of species distribution modeling. We also investigated differential influences of environmental variables in the upper lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron) and lower lakes (Lakes St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario). Basin-wide results showed that the coastal areas most vulnerable to <i>Phragmites</i> expansion were in close proximity to developed lands and had minimal topographic relief, poorly drained soils, and dense road networks. Elevated nutrients and proximity to agriculture also influenced the distribution of <i>Phragmites</i>. Climate predictions indicated an increase in suitable habitat in coastal Lakes Huron and Michigan in particular. The results of this study, combined with a publicly available online decision support tool, will enable resource managers and restoration practitioners to target and prioritize <i>Phragmites</i> control efforts in the Great Lakes coastal zone.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"<p><span>Using various available time series for Lake Michigan, we examined changes in the Lake Michigan food web following the dreissenid mussel invasions and identified those changes most likely attributable to these invasions, thereby providing a synthesis. Expansion of the quagga mussel (</span><i>Dreissena rostriformis bugensis</i><span>) population into deeper waters, which began around 2004, appeared to have a substantial predatory effect on both phytoplankton abundance and primary production, with annual primary production in offshore (&gt;&nbsp;50&nbsp;m deep) waters being reduced by about 35% by 2007. Primary production likely decreased in nearshore waters as well, primarily due to predatory effects exerted by the quagga mussel expansion. The drastic decline in</span><i>Diporeia</i><span>&nbsp;abundance in Lake Michigan during the 1990s and 2000s has been attributed to dreissenid mussel effects, but the exact mechanism by which the mussels were negatively affecting&nbsp;</span><i>Diporeia</i><span>&nbsp;abundance remains unknown.

However, lake-wide biomass of salmonines, top predators in the food web, remained high during the 2000s, and consumption of alewives by salmonines actually increased between the 1980–1995 and 1996–2011 time periods. Moreover, abundance of the lake whitefish population, which supports Lake Michigan's most valuable commercial fishery, remained at historically high levels during the 2000s. Apparently, counterbalancing mechanisms operating within the complex Lake Michigan food web have enabled salmonines and lake whitefish to retain relatively high abundances despite reduced primary production.</span></p>\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Silver carp <i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i> (SVC) and bighead carp <i>H. nobilis</i> (BHC) have impacted waters in the US since their escape. Current chemical controls for aquatic nuisance species are non-selective. Development of a bioactive micro-particle that exploits filter-feeding habits of SVC or BHC could result in a new control tool. It is not fully understood if SVC or BHC will consume bioactive micro-particles. Two discrete trials were performed to: 1) evaluate if SVC and BHC consume the candidate micro-particle formulation; 2) determine what size they consume; 3) establish methods to evaluate consumption of filter-feeders for future experiments. Both SVC and BHC were exposed to small (50-100 μm) and large (150-200 μm) micro-particles in two 24-h trials. Particles in water were counted electronically and manually (microscopy). Particles on gill rakers were counted manually and intestinal tracts inspected for the presence of micro-particles. In Trial 1, both manual and electronic count data confirmed reductions of both size particles; SVC appeared to remove more small particles than large; more BHC consumed particles; SVC had fewer overall particles in their gill rakers than BHC. In Trial 2, electronic counts confirmed reductions of both size particles; both SVC and BHC consumed particles, yet more SVC consumed micro-particles compared to BHC. Of the fish that ate micro-particles, SVC consumed more than BHC. It is recommended to use multiple metrics to assess consumption of candidate micro-particles by filter-feeders when attempting to distinguish differential particle consumption. This study has implications for developing micro-particles for species-specific delivery of bioactive controls to help fisheries, provides some methods for further experiments with bioactive micro-particles, and may also have applications in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled \\\\\"Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan\\\\\". This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of three-dimensional point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana, on September 1, 2015. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using a YSI EcoMapper autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a YSI 6600 V2-4 bulkhead housing a YSI 6560FR fast response temperature/conductivity probe, YSI 6589FR fast response pH sensor, YSI 6150 ROX optical dissolved oxygen sensor, YSI 6136 turbidity sensor, YSI 6025 chlorophyll sensor, and YSI 6131 BGA-PC phycocyanin (blue-green algae) sensor. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the AUV completed the pre-programmed survey pattern of the nearshore zone. The AUV was programmed to continually undulate between the water surface and 4 feet above the bottom (dive angle of 15 degrees) as it moved at 2 knots between programmed waypoints along it survey mission path. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> USEPA Region 5 previously funded a study in 2011 evaluating the toxicity of nitrogen compounds to a select number of pond-dwelling amphibians. The objective of this new study will be to determine the toxicity of nitrogen compounds to stream-dwelling amphibians. Nitrogen contamination in aquatic systems results from the decomposition of organic matter, as well as through agricultural inputs, sewage effluents and industrial activities. Nitrogen in its various forms is of ecological concern because of its ubiquitous distribution and toxicity to aquatic life. Nitrogen compounds pose a hazard to aquatic larval stages of amphibians, affecting survival and development, and inducing deformities and behavioral impairments. Declines in amphibian populations have been correlated with the prevalence of nitrogen-based fertilizer applications. Chronic toxicity studies conducted with ammonia determined that deformities and delayed development of R. pipiens, B. americanus, and R. clamitans resulted from chronic exposures conducted over the course of larval development to metamorphosis. Uncertainties posed by that study arose from inconsistent dosing as well as high control mortality. Limited testing suggests that water quality criteria for ammonia are likely to be protective of amphibians, yet limited information about the effects of exposure to stream dwelling amphibians and the consequences of sublethal injuries precludes verification. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>Aquatic food webs that incorporate multiple energy channels (e.g. nearshore benthic or pelagic) with varying productivity and turnover rates convey stability to biological communities by providing multiple independent energy sources. Within the Lake Michigan food web, invasive dreissenid mussels have caused rapid changes to food web structure and potentially altered the channels through which consumers acquire energy. We used stable C and N isotopes to determine how Lake Michigan food web structure has changed in the past decade, coincident with the expansion of dreissenid mussels, decreased pelagic phytoplankton production and increased nearshore benthic algal production. Fish and invertebrate samples collected from sites around Lake Michigan were analyzed to determine taxa-specific 13C:12C (delta 13C) and 15N:14N (delta 15N) ratios. Sampling took place during two distinct periods, 2002-2003 and 2010-2012, that spanned the period of dreissenid expansion, and included nearshore, pelagic and profundal fish and invertebrate taxa. Magnitude and direction of the \\uf06413C shift indicated significantly greater reliance upon nearshore benthic energy sources among nearly all fish taxa as well as profundal invertebrates. Although the mechanisms underlying this \\uf06413C shift likely varied among species, possible causes include the transport of benthic algal production to offshore waters and an increased reliance on nearshore prey items. Delta 15N shifts were more variable and of smaller magnitude across taxa although declines in delta 15N among some pelagic fishes may indicate a shift to alternative prey resources. Lake Michigan fishes and invertebrates appear to have responded to dreissenid induced changes in nutrient and energy pathways by switching from pelagic to alternative nearshore energy subsidies. Although large shifts in energy allocation (i.e. pelagic to nearshore benthic) resulting from invasive species appear to have affected total production at upper trophic levels, changes in trophic structure and utilization of novel energy pathways may help to stabilize food webs following species invasions.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Terrestrial agricultural activities strongly influence riverine nitrogen (N) dynamics, which is reflected in the δ<sup>15</sup>N of riverine consumer tissues. However, processes within aquatic ecosystems also influence consumer tissue δ<sup>15</sup>N. As aquatic processes become more important terrestrial inputs may become a weaker predictor of consumer tissue δ<sup>15</sup>N. In a previous study, this terrestrial-consumer tissue δ<sup>15</sup>N connection was very strong at river sites, but was disrupted by processes occurring in rivermouths (the ‘rivermouth effect’). This suggested that watershed indicators of N loading might be accurate in riverine settings, but could be inaccurate when considering N loading to the nearshore of large lakes and oceans. In this study, the rivermouth effect was examined on twenty-five sites spread across the Laurentian Great Lakes. Relationships between agriculture and consumer tissue δ<sup>15</sup>N occurred in both upstream rivers and at the outlets where rivermouths connect to the nearshore zone, but agriculture explained less variation and had a weaker effect at the outlet. These results suggest that rivermouths may sometimes be significant sources or sinks of N, which would cause N loading estimates to the nearshore zone that are typically made at discharge gages further upstream to be inaccurate. Identifying definitively the controls over the rivermouth effect on N loading (and other nutrients) will require integration of biogeochemical and hydrologic models.',\n",

Otolith microchemistry and the capture location of these fish permitted the conclusion that they were most likely produced in the Sandusky River. Due to this finding, we sampled ichthyoplankton using paired bongo net tows and larval light traps during June–August of 2014 and 2015 to determine if grass carp are spawning in the Sandusky River. From the samples collected in 2015, we identified and staged eight eggs that were morphologically consistent with grass carp. Five eggs were confirmed as grass carp using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction for a grass carp-specific marker, while the remaining three were retained for future analysis. Our finding confirms that grass carp are naturally spawning in this Great Lakes tributary. All eggs were collected during high-flow events, either on the day of peak flow or 1–2&nbsp;days following peak flow, supporting an earlier suggestion that high flow conditions favor grass carp spawning. The next principal goal is to identify the spawning and hatch location(s) for the Sandusky River. Predicting locations and conditions where grass carp spawning is most probable may aid targeted management efforts.</span></p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled “Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan”. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of bathymetric soundings in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach at Jackson Park at Hyde Park, Illinois. Water column depths were measured using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz Rio Grande acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted to a U.S. Geological Survey hydrographic survey vessel. The water column depths from the four diverging beams of the ADCP have been corrected for instrument heading, pitch, and roll and georectified using The Velocity Mapping Toolbox (https://hydroacoustics.usgs.gov/movingboat/VMT/VMT.shtml). Geolocation of the beam soundings was possible using a Hemisphere Crescent A100 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted directly above the ADCP. This GPS receiver has sub-meter horizontal accuracy when operated in differential mode. The edited water column depths were transformed to lake bed elevations using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s Calumet Harbor Water Level Gage (9087044) which records at 6-minute intervals. This gage is located approximately 4.6 miles south of the survey site. Bed elevations have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a foot.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4>Excessive nutrient and sediment concentrations and loads have been documented in many tributaries to the Great Lakes. Many efforts have been made during the first 5 years of GLRI to reduce nutrient and sediment concentrations in streams and rivers throughout the Great Lakes Basin, and these efforts will continue during Phase II of GLRI. In order to determine the success of these efforts at improving water quality, it is important to document in a systematic manner the water quality and loading from key tributaries to the Great Lakes.<h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4>The objectives of this project are to: 1) Collect streamflow and samples for sediment and nutrients for major streams that are tributary to the Great Lakes 2) Provide daily, monthly and annual loads for all constituents 3) Develop regressions to allow for real-time estimates of loads using water-quality sensors collecting either actual constituent concentrations or surrogates that reflect variations in the constituent concentration<h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4>The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information of current loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries.<h4>Products</h4>Great Lakes Tributary Nutrient and Sediment Monitoring Program and A Surrogate Regression Approach for Computing Continuous Loads, Dale M. Robertson, Laura E. Hubbard, David L. Lorenz, and Daniel J. Sullivan<h4>Approach</h4>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists collect real-time, near-real-time, and synoptic flow and water-quality data (sediment and nutrients) from tributaries to the Great Lakes. The data provide baseline information to assess effectiveness of restoration and land management activities. Thirty of the 59 major downstream flow gages are continuously operating for water-quality samplings at these sites (number of sites reduced to 25 effective June 30, 2013). The work builds on current USGS monitoring efforts and those of partners in the Great Lakes. The results of this effort will provide information on nutrient and sediment loads and measure the effectiveness of restoration efforts in selected tributaries. The USGS nutrient tributary monitoring network follows the National Monitoring Network for Coastal Waters design. Site-specific regression equations are being developed to relate selected laboratory-analyzed analyte concentrations in the discrete samples to measurements recorded by the water-quality monitors. This will enable near-continuous estimates of analytes and allow a reduction in laboratory samples, reducing costs while preserving temporal density of data. This work supports Great Lakes Lakewide Area Management Plans and Remedial Action Plans.<h4>Key Findings</h4>Three to five years of data is now available depending on the sites. Water samples collected at the 30 tributary monitoring sites include suspended sediment; nutrients; and chloride. One sample per storm event is analyzed for major ions. At each site, monthly base flow samples are being collected, plus up to eight storms, with 6 samples submitted per storm (60 environmental samples per site). Samples are being used to develop statistical relations between continuously measured parameters and lab analyzed parameters. In-situ water-quality sensors deployed at each site measure turbidity, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH every 15 minutes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The success of an environmental monitoring study using passive samplers, or any sampling method, begins in the office or laboratory. Regardless of the specific methods used, the general steps include the formulation of a sampling plan, training of personnel, performing the field (sampling) work, processing the collected samples to recover chemicals of interest, analysis of the enriched extracts, and interpretation of the data. Each of these areas will be discussed in the following sections with emphasis on specific considerations with the use of passive samplers. Water is an extremely heterogeneous matrix both spatially and temporally (Keith, 1991). The mixing and distribution of dissolved organic chemicals in a water body are controlled by the hydrodynamics of the water, the sorption partition coefficients of the chemicals, and the amount of organic matter (suspended sediments, colloids, and dissolved organic carbon) present. In lakes and oceans, stratification because of changes in temperature, water movement, and water composition can occur resulting in dramatic changes in chemical concentrations with depth (Keith, 1991). Additional complications related to episodic events, such as surface runoff, spills, and other point source contamination, can result in isolated or short-lived pulses of contaminants in the water. The application of passive sampling technologies for the monitoring of legacy and emerging organic chemicals in the environment is becoming widely accepted worldwide. The primary use of passive sampling methods for environmental studies is in the area of surface-water monitoring; however, these techniques have been applied to air and groundwater monitoring studies. Although these samplers have no mechanical or moving parts, electrical or fuel needs which require regular monitoring, there are still considerations that need to be understood in order to have a successful study. Two of the most commonly used passive samplers for organic contaminants are the semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) and the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS). The tips given in this document focus on these two samplers but are applicable to most types of passive sampling devices. The information in this guide is heavily weighted towards the sampling of water; however, information specific to the use of SPMDs for air sampling will also be covered.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p><span>Organic compounds used in agriculture, industry, and households make their way into surface waters through runoff, leaking septic-conveyance systems, regulated and unregulated discharges, and combined sewer overflows, among other sources. Concentrations of these organic waste compounds (OWCs) in some Great Lakes tributaries indicate a high potential for adverse impacts on aquatic organisms. During 2010–13, 709 water samples were collected at 57 tributaries, together representing approximately 41% of the total inflow to the lakes. Samples were collected during runoff and low-flow conditions and analyzed for 69 OWCs, including herbicides, insecticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, plasticizers, antioxidants, detergent metabolites, fire retardants, non-prescription human drugs, flavors/fragrances, and dyes. Urban-related land cover characteristics were the most important explanatory variables of concentrations of many OWCs. Compared to samples from nonurban watersheds (&lt;&nbsp;15% urban land cover) samples from urban watersheds (&gt;&nbsp;15% urban land cover) had nearly four times the number of detected compounds and four times the total sample concentration, on average. Concentration differences between runoff and low-flow conditions were not observed, but seasonal differences were observed in atrazine, metolachlor, DEET, and HHCB concentrations. Water quality benchmarks for individual OWCs were exceeded at 20 sites, and at 7 sites benchmarks were exceeded by a factor of 10 or more. The compounds with the most frequent water quality benchmark exceedances were the PAHs benzo[</span><i>a</i><span>]pyrene, pyrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene, the detergent metabolite 4-nonylphenol, and the herbicide atrazine. Computed estradiol equivalency quotients (EEQs) using only nonsteroidal endocrine-active compounds indicated medium to high risk of estrogenic effects (intersex or vitellogenin induction) at 10 sites. EEQs at 3 sites were comparable to values reported in effluent. This multifaceted study is the largest, most comprehensive assessment of the occurrence and potential effects of OWCs in the Great Lakes Basin to date.</span></p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In a series of studies along the Great Lakes, U.S. Geological Survey scientists are examining the physical processes that influence concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and related pathogens at recreational beaches. These studies aim to estimate human health risk, improve management strategies, and understand the fate and transport of microbes in the nearshore area. It was determined that embayed beaches act as traps, accumulating <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> and other bacteria in the basin and even in beach sand. Further, shear stress and wave run-up could resuspend accumulated bacteria, leading to water-contamination events. These findings are being used to target beach design and circulation projects. In previous research, it was determined that <i>E. coli</i> followed a diurnal pattern, with concentrations decreasing throughout the day, largely owing to solar inactivation, but rebounding overnight. Studies at a Chicago beach identified the impact of wave-induced mass transport on this phenomenon, a finding that will extend our understanding of bacterial fate in the natural environment. In another series of studies, scientists examined the impact of river outfalls on bacteria concentrations, using mechanistic and empirical modeling. Through these studies, the models can indicate range and extent of impact, given <i>E. coli</i> concentration in the source water. These findings have been extended to extended lengths of coastlines and have been applied in beach management using empirical predictive modeling. Together, these studies are helping scientists identify and eliminate threats to human and coastal health.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Developing and implementing the use of predictive models for estimating water quality at Great Lakes beaches',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Predictive models have been used at beaches to improve the timeliness and accuracy of recreational water-quality assessments over the most common current approach to water-quality monitoring, which relies on culturing fecal-indicator bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli.)</i>. Beach-specific predictive models use environmental and water-quality variables that are easily and quickly measured as surrogates to estimate concentrations of fecal-indicator bacteria or to provide the probability that a State recreational water-quality standard will be exceeded. When predictive models are used for beach closure or advisory decisions, they are referred to as “nowcasts.” During the recreational seasons of 2010-12, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with 23 local and State agencies, worked to improve existing nowcasts at 4 beaches, validate predictive models at another 38 beaches, and collect data for predictive-model development at 7 beaches throughout the Great Lakes. This report summarizes efforts to collect data and develop predictive models by multiple agencies and to compile existing information on the beaches and beach-monitoring programs into one comprehensive report. <p>Local agencies measured <i>E. coli</i> concentrations and variables expected to affect <i>E. coli</i> concentrations such as wave height, turbidity, water temperature, and numbers of birds at the time of sampling. In addition to these field measurements, equipment was installed by the USGS or local agencies at or near several beaches to collect water-quality and metrological measurements in near real time, including nearshore buoys, weather stations, and tributary staff gages and monitors. The USGS worked with local agencies to retrieve data from existing sources either manually or by use of tools designed specifically to compile and process data for predictive-model development.</p> <p>Predictive models were developed by use of linear regression and (or) partial least squares techniques for 42 beaches that had at least 2 years of data (2010-11 and sometimes earlier) and for 1 beach that had 1 year of data. For most models, software designed for model development by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Virtual Beach) was used. The selected model for each beach was based on a combination of explanatory variables including, most commonly, turbidity, day of the year, change in lake level over 24 hours, wave height, wind direction and speed, and antecedent rainfall for various time periods. Forty-two predictive models were validated against data collected during an independent year (2012) and compared to the current method for assessing recreational water quality-using the previous day’s <i>E. coli</i> concentration (persistence model). Goals for good predictive-model performance were responses that were at least 5 percent greater than the persistence model and overall correct responses greater than or equal to 80 percent, sensitivities (percentage of exceedances of the bathing-water standard that were correctly predicted by the model) greater than or equal to 50 percent, and specificities (percentage of nonexceedances correctly predicted by the model) greater than or equal to 85 percent. Out of 42 predictive models, 24 models yielded over-all correct responses that were at least 5 percent greater than the use of the persistence model. Predictive-model responses met the performance goals more often than the persistence-model responses in terms of overall correctness (28 versus 17 models, respectively), sensitivity (17 versus 4 models), and specificity (34 versus 25 models). Gaining knowledge of each beach and the factors that affect <i>E. coli</i> concentrations is important for developing good predictive models. Collection of additional years of data with a wide range of environmental conditions may also help to improve future model performance. The USGS will continue to work with local agencies in 2013 and beyond to develop and validate predictive models at beaches and improve existing nowcasts, restructuring monitoring activities to accommodate future uncertainties in funding and resources.</p>',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The USGS measures water levels at the adult Asian Carp barrier fence in Eagle Marsh and reports those data hourly to a USGS website. The barrier fence is an 8 foot tall, nearly 1,200 foot chain link fence across a part of Eagle Marsh. When flooding raises water levels at the fence, alerts are sent to State and local biologists and resource staff who respond and inspect the fence line for adult Asian Carp and debris accumulation.<br> <br> The USGS also measures streamflow and water temperature at two sites downstream from Eagle Marsh to evaluate how precipitation in area watersheds causes streamflow and water levels to increase and how temporary changes in flow directions downstream on Graham McCulloch Ditch and Junk Ditch affect flooding and development of intermittent flow connections at Eagle Marsh.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> USGS water monitoring provides data to design and maintain a barrier between the Wabash River and Maumee River basins at Eagle Marsh to prevent Asian carp from moving through this water pathway into Lake Erie. Plans by Federal, State and local partners to raise and widen an existing berm on Graham-McCulloch Ditch across Eagle Marsh and prevent Carp migration during floods depend on an understanding of how much water flows through streams that leave the marsh.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Water-level, streamflow and water temperature measurements and in-person observations after storms in 2013 identified how the Wabash River basin intermittently connects with the Maumee Basin (Lake Erie) during flood events at and near Eagle Marsh such that adult Asian Carp, if present, could bypass the current berm structures.<br> During some high water events, common carp were identified in the marsh in pooled water and at the temporary barrier fence. No Asian carp were observed.<br> Flooding in Graham McCulloch Ditch and Junk Ditch during June 2013, after a local rainfall of about 4-5 inches rain/24 hours produced a brief, several day flow connection at Eagle Marsh during a period when water temperatures (≥17-25 °C) were potentially favorable to carp movement.<br> Measurements on Junk Ditch identified how flood-related flows in the St. Mary’s River, a Maumee River tributary, reversed into Junk Ditch and into Eagle Marsh.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> Indiana Department of Natural Resources&nbsp;website&nbsp;of description and photos of adult carp barrier:<br> <br> <a href=\\\\\"http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/58486.htm\\\\\">http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/58486.htm</a><br> <br> Links to USGS water-level data&nbsp;at the adult carp barrier fence and streamflow and temperature data on either side of the basin divide:<br> <br> <a href=\\\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323583&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\\\\\">03323583 EAGLE MARSH EAST NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN</a><br> <a href=\\\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323584&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\\\\\">03323584 EAGLE MARSH WEST NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN</a><br> <a href=\\\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=03323587&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\\\\\">03323587 GRAHAM MCCULLOCH DITCH NEAR FORT WAYNE, IN (Wabash River/Mississippi River basin)</a><br> <a href=\\\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/in/nwis/uv/?site_no=04182755&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060,00010\\\\\">04182755 JUNK DITCH AT FORT WAYNE, IN (Maumee River/Lake Erie basin)</a><br> <br> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&nbsp;report&nbsp;on GLMRIS Aquatic Nuisance Species Controls:<br> <br> <a href=\\\\\"http://www.glmris.anl.gov/documents/docs/interim/Eagle_Marsh_ANS_Controls_Report.pdf\\\\\">Alternative H: Reconstruction of the Left Descending Graham-McCulloch Ditch Berm along the Eagle Marsh (pg.46) is similar to the basin separation remedy currently under design.</a><br> &nbsp;',\n",

This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of continuous measurements of nearshore currents in Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana (USGS 04092788). Currents were measured and averaged over 10-minute intervals using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz ChannelMaster acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) mounted to the eastern most round protection cell in the breakwater wall and the instrument was oriented 142.1 degrees from true North. The ADVM was configured with a 6-meter blanking distance, ten 8 meter measurement cells, and a total profiling distance of 86 meters from the face of the instrument. The average depth of the transducers below the water surface was approximately 2.3 meters and the physical coordinates of the instrument in the Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16N WGS84 projection are 464087.2 meters East, 4611222.4 meters North. The instrument was deployed on August 4, 2015 and recovered on October 2, 2015.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"<h4>Description of Work</h4> The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) was established to accelerate ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes by confronting the most serious threats to the region, such as nonpoint source pollution, toxic sediments, and invasive species. Three Priority Watersheds have been targeted by the Regional Working Group's Phosphorus Reduction Work Group (Fox/Green Bay, Saginaw, and Maumee) and are characterized by having a high density of agricultural land use and have ecosystem impairments that have been clearly identified. Within the Maumee River Priority Watersheds, monitoring is being conducted at the sub-watershed, edge-of-field, and subsurface-tile scale. The edge-of-field and subsurface-tile monitoring stations are targeted to those areas within each watershed that will be directly affected by the conservation efforts. These sites will allow for a rapid assessment of conservation implementation as the water quality from those locations are immediately affected by land-use and management changes and represent the major pathways for non-point pollution to enter receiving streams. Relationships between the small to sub-watershed scale will help develop an understanding on how conservation efforts may impact the watershed as a whole. This effort will accelerate quantification of current and ongoing efforts in the Blanchard GLRI Priority subwatershed with a focus on the smallest scale of implementation (field scale) and is responsive to RWG questions/requests regarding the need to quantify impacts of priority GLRI activities through relevant science and monitoring. USGS will undertake and coordinate a multi-agency effort to predict losses of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from individual fields using established water quality monitoring networks and simulation tools. Results may be scaled-up to examine broader scale effects and reasonable/achievable reductions that can be expected from targeted activities. Coordination among scientists, water quality specialists, and modelers in NRCS, USGS, EPA, and partnering universities is expected. Linkages between this work and ongoing Great Lakes efforts to establish target loads for subwatersheds (e.g., Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement) will be explored. <br /> &nbsp;\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Microcosms to Evaluate Elevated Major Ions',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Elevated concentrations of major ions are associated with a variety of discharges to aquatic ecosystems, including urban wastewater, mountain top removal and valley fill operations, and coal bed methane production. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the toxicity of major ions to aquatic organisms, particularly given the variability of constituents that comprise these effluents. Because the relative toxicity of major ions is highly variable, predicting effects based on conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS) or other composite measures may be simplistic. Furthermore, most of the available information on sensitivity of aquatic organisms to major ions has been derived from short-term laboratory toxicity tests conducted with surrogate species. There is relatively little information on the sensitivity of aquatic insects to elevated major ions. Field studies showed that abundance of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) was significantly lower in streams receiving elevated TDS associated with mountaintop removal and valley fill operations. Based on an extensive survey of central Appalachian streams, the U.S. EPA developed a benchmark for conductivity in areas affected by mountain top and valley fill operations. However, these analyses have been criticized because of the lack of experimental evidence showing that mayflies and other macroinvertebrates are sensitive to elevated major ions. These experiments will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of major ions will negatively impact benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Experiments will be conducted in stream microcosms to quantify responses of different groups of macroinvertebrates to elevated levels of major ions. The specific ions used in our experiments will be determined after consultation with EPA and USGS researchers. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since Pacific salmon stocking began in Lake Michigan, managers have attempted to maintain salmon abundance at high levels within what can be sustained by available prey fishes, primarily Alewife <i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>. Chinook Salmon <i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i> are the primary apex predators in pelagic Lake Michigan and patterns in their prey selection (by species and size) may strongly influence pelagic prey fish communities in any given year. In 1994–1996, there were larger Alewives, relatively more abundant alternative prey species, fewer Chinook Salmon, and fewer invasive species in Lake Michigan than in 2009–2010. The years 2009–2010 were instead characterized by smaller, leaner Alewives, fewer alternative prey species, higher abundance of Chinook Salmon, a firmly established nonnative benthic community, and reduced abundance of <i>Diporeia</i>, an important food of Lake Michigan prey fish. We characterized Chinook Salmon diets, prey species selectivity, and prey size selectivity between 1994–1996 and 2009–2010 time periods. In 1994–1996, Alewife as prey represented a smaller percentage of Chinook Salmon diets than in 2009–2010, when alewife comprised over 90% of Chinook Salmon diets, possibly due to declines in alternative prey fish populations. The size of Alewives eaten by Chinook Salmon also decreased between these two time periods. For the largest Chinook Salmon in 2009–2010, the average size of Alewife prey was nearly 50 mm total length shorter than in 1994–1996. We suggest that changes in the Lake Michigan food web, such as the decline in <i>Diporeia</i>, may have contributed to the relatively low abundance of large Alewives during the late 2000s by heightening the effect of predation from top predators like Chinook Salmon, which have retained a preference for Alewife and now forage with greater frequency on smaller Alewives.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will develop and provide forecasting tools for managers to determine how water withdrawals or other hydrologic or land use changes in watersheds may affect Great Lakes ecosystems. This information will help guide restoration efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness and success. Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function. The project relies upon regionally consistent hydrologic, biologic, and geospatial data to generate regionally consistent estimates, models, and analysis. USGS is the Circular A-16 theme lead for hydrographic spatial data. As such USGS has responsibility to coordinate with other federal agencies, states, and other entities the development and stewardship of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). USGS also has developed in partnership with EPA the NHDPlus, it has a memorandum of understanding with The Nature Conservancy to study environmental flows and impacts of hydrologic alterations on ecology. USGS has been a lead agency in the development of techniques and methods to estimate streamflow characteristics in gaged and ungaged watersheds and in developing, applying, and coordinating research in ecology and hydroecology. Products from this research will include a consistent hydrologic dataset of the US Great Lakes Basin built on the 1:100,000 NHDplus and attributed with landscape and aquatic ecologic variables. Empirical models developed for fish distribution, temperature, and streamflow will be developed. A hierarchical lotic habitat classification framework and fish-based lotic habitat classification will be built on the hydrologic dataset.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Project provides unified information across the Great Lakes Basin for ecosystem restoration, assessment, and management by incorporating models that relate changes in landscape and hydrologic variables and stresses to changes in ecosystem function.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Scientists updated the AFINCH analysis program to improve the ability of the analyst to archive and reproduce simulation results. The AFINCH analysis program is menu-driven, and, prior to this update, reproducing simulations would require the analyst to read through a log file written by the program and manually inputting the required information into the AFINCH program again. The program was updated to write and read an XML file that archives both the user input values and the AFINCH program regression results. Reproducing a simulation is streamlined as an analyst can now provide the XML file to the program to quickly set up the simulation and read the required information. The analyst can also verify that the reproduced simulation results match the original simulation. Project researchers worked with the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) to develop an on-line mapper that will deliver the time series of ungaged flow estimates produced by AFINCH to the public. Initial versions of the software have been developed and these will be refined during the remainder of FY13. Preliminary relations describing fish species response to altered streamflow also were developed. These relations will be refined as AFINCH flow estimates are finalized.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> A <strong>mapping tool</strong> was developed, which allows users to explore and download gaged stream flow as well as modeled stream flow and catchment yield from AFINCH.

Flow, velocity and a suite of water-quality parameters (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae, nitrate and turbidity) will be collected in the main channel and backwater areas of the river. Plankton sampling data from the Illinois Department of Natural History will be used to characterize the available food supply in this reach of the river. Day-to-day movement of Asian carp recorded from field observations and telemetered fish (IDNR/USFWS/USACE/Southern Illinois University (SIU)) will be analyzed with the flow and water-quality data to evaluate fish response to changing flow conditions. Existing data, including long-term water-quality sampling by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) of Greater Chicago will be reviewed. In addition to a greater understanding of why Asian carp have not moved further upstream, the velocity and flow data will be evaluated to determine optimum locations (channel constrictions, pinch points, backwater areas, etc.) within the river that may be suitable for the testing of Asian carp control strategies. The applicability of this methodology will be evaluated for the downstream sections of the Illinois River.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Greater understanding of Asian carps preferred habitat with regards to hydraulic and water-quality characteristics and insight into how habitat may be altered to deter them from spreading into new areas.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Findings will be reported as the project progresses.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> The hydraulic and water-quality data collected in the Illinois River&nbsp; <a href=\\\\\"http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/il/nwis/uv/?site_no=411955088280601&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060\\\\\">backwater near Morris, Illinois</a>&nbsp;and in the&nbsp; <a href=\\\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?05543010\\\\\">main channel at Seneca, Illinois</a>&nbsp;are available in real-time.<br> <br> James J.

A standard guide for conducting water-only laboratory toxicity tests with freshwater mussels was approved in 2006 (ASTM 2008a) and provides a tested and validated, consensus-based methodology for conducting acute or chronic water toxicity tests with the early life stages (glochidia and juveniles) of freshwater mussels. Several recent peer-reviewed scientific publications have presented data on various toxicants (Bringolf et al. 2007a,b,c; Wang et al. 2007a,b,c) generated with this method and demonstrate consistency and reliability in inter-laboratory (round robin) toxicity tests similar to other aquatic organisms (Wang et al. 2007a). Because sediments are critical to the existence of an already imperiled mussel fauna, assessing the effects of sediment-associated contaminants and evaluating their quality in a more standard approach would enable more effective protection and conservation. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

The code is written in C++ and is a formulation and expansion of the algorithms included in PEST, a widely used parameter estimation code written in Fortran. The new code is called PEST++ and is designed to lower the barriers of entry for users and developers while providing efficient algorithms that can accommodate large, highly parameterized problems. This effort has focused on (1) implementing the most popular features of PEST in a fashion that is easy for novice or experienced modelers to use and (2) creating a software design that is easy to extend; that is, this effort provides a documented object-oriented framework designed from the ground up to be modular and extensible. In addition, all PEST++ source code and its associated libraries, as well as the general run manager source code, have been integrated in the Microsoft Visual Studio® 2010 integrated development environment. The PEST++ code is designed to provide a foundation for an open-source development environment capable of producing robust and efficient parameter estimation tools for the environmental modeling community into the future.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Avian Botulism in Distressed Great Lakes Environments',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> A Department of Interior team, including U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), is working to determine why botulism outbreaks, which have killed large numbers of fish and fish-eating birds, are occurring in the Great Lakes. This project will determine: 1) a quick assay test for the presence of the toxin , 2) how birds are exposed to the toxins, and 3) what factors combined trigger an outbreak. This information will be used to formulate management strategies. Botulism intoxication is caused by ingestion of neurotoxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Periodic outbreaks of type E botulism have resulted in die-offs of fish and fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes since at least the 1960s, but outbreaks have become more common and widespread since 1999. Botulism has been responsible for over 100,000 bird deaths on the Great Lakes since 1999, and extensive bird mortality in northern Lake Michigan near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE; over 4150 birds in 2007) received widespread press attention and caused great public concern. The actual sites of toxin exposure for birds remain unknown. Spores of C. botulinum are naturally widely distributed in the environment, but toxin production occurs only when suitable environmental conditions allow spore germination and cell growth, and this may be related to local soil and water conditions. The physical and ecological factors that are associated with toxin production, waterbird exposure, and botulism outbreaks are poorly understood in the Great Lakes, as in other environments. Invasive species, particularly dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp. and round gobies Neogobius melanostomus, have been implicated in the recent increased occurrence of botulism mortality in Great Lakes fish and birds, but this has not been proven. Dreissenid mussels may enhance nearshore algal growth, and decomposing algae may help create the anoxic conditions required for C. botulinum germination. We hypothesize that recent increases in the incidence of type E avian botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes may be associated with the presence of large amounts of decomposing sloughed Cladophora. We propose to determine the presence or absence of C. botulinum and type E botulinum toxin in sediments. In FY 2013, targeted sampling sites will be chosen in northern Lake Michigan near SLBE to represent sites that support varying amounts of sloughed Cladophora at a range of depths throughout the season.We further propose to use population surveys to assess waterbird distribution, with emphasis on species historically impacted by type E botulism (e.g., Common Loon Gavia immer), to examine the spatial relationships between bird distribution and carcass detection of confirmed botulism mortalities, and to analyze the relation between botulism in birds and environmental conditions at locations where toxin exposure is likely to occur.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Botulinum toxin is the most toxic natural substance on earth. Botulism has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of fish and birds in the Great Lakes since 1999, including federally endangered Piping Plovers and imperiled lake sturgeon. The proliferation of botulism in the Great Lakes represents a serious challenge to Great Lakes restoration efforts. Through this GLRI-funded project, the USGS is bringing together scientists with diverse areas of expertise to address botulism outbreaks in the Great Lakes. This team of experts is taking a comprehensive approach to understanding what factors need to link together to trigger a botulism outbreak, and how future outbreaks can be predicted and prevented in the Great Lakes. Scientists are developing methods to detect the presence of botulinum toxin in the environment and determining how the botulinum toxin reaches bird populations through Great Lakes food webs.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> GLRI funding is now allowing USGS scientists to make breakthroughs in the prediction and prevention of botulism outbreaks. Scientists have developed and are refining a rapid and cost-effective methodology to detect botulinum toxin. This technology is an important tool that will make assessment of the presence of botulinum toxin much more efficient in the Great Lakes. This technology will also have valuable applications to other systems. This GLRI project is providing critical information toward understanding the factors that promote the proliferation of botulinum toxin in the Great Lakes. The information that this project is generating allows managers to better predict future outbreaks and, ultimately, will allow managers to develop strategies to prevent future outbreaks from occurring, providing great benefits to restoration efforts for the Great Lakes.<br> <br> Sediment samples were collected during 2010-2012 near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, on Lake Michigan. A total of 435 samples were analyzed for the presence of the botulinum toxin gene. Results from this analysis are used to understand the ways through which birds come into contact with botulinum toxin. A new method to detect botulinum toxin has been developed that performs as well as the “gold-standard” traditional method. The new method is faster and cheaper than the traditional method, and is a major step forward in the study of botulism. Scientists have learned that avian botulism is the main cause of bird mortality in Lake Michigan. Over 950 sick or dead birds have been collected through this project. Seventy-six birds have been tested for botulinum toxin, of which 42 were positive (55% positive). The distribution and migration of over 175 Common Loons have been tracked to reveal where loons are likely to be exposed to prey fish carrying botulinum toxin.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> Scientists obtained the first ever <strong>dive profiles</strong> for loons and have learned that loons dive as deep as 150 feet to feed in Lake Michigan.<br> <br> You can track movements of loons by visiting the USGS loon migration <strong>website</strong>: ( <a href=\\\\\"http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/terrestrial/migratory_birds/loons/migrations.html\\\\\">http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/terrestrial/migratory_birds/loons/migrations.html</a>)<br> <br> A <strong>citizen science program</strong> (Lake Michigan Volunteer AMBLE: Avian Monitoring for Botulism Lakeshore Events) was established to collect data on bird carcasses that wash ashore near Sleeping Bear Dunes and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and across the lake in Door County, Wisconsin. This team effort has considerably increased our knowledge of the timing, numbers, and species affected by avian botulism.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'title': '3.2 - 678-1 Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"<h4>Description of Work</h4>The success of GLRI beach restoration projects must be assessed to determine whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences of restoration efforts. Implementation of multiple BMPs during restoration can make understanding the impacts of individual BMPs difficult. However, proper site selection and well-designed monitoring and assessment plan can overcome such difficulties. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models.<h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4>The objectives for the evaluation of urban beach restorations include the following: 1) Consolidate environmental data (physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social) and targeted pre-restoration conditions at the three locations. 2) Install monitoring equipment, collect data, and assimilate current targeted conditions. 3) Collect post-restoration environmental data through targeted studies based on restoration goals at each location. 4) Compare pre- and post- environmental data and evaluate targeted restoration conditions and goals. 5) Through microbial community analysis, gain insight into microbial differences by beach, seasonal shifts and better projected trends in community representation and trophic changes resulting from climate change. 6) Project potential effects of climate change on restoration efficacy. 7) Relate findings to other appropriate GLRI funded restoration projects with anticipated outcomes. 8) Utilize data and results to inform efforts to remove of the beach closings BUI for the Grand Calumet River AOC.<h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4>This project meets the priorities of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan II for Science-Based Adaptive Management. It also fits into the USGS GLRI Science Framework Science Integration and Delivery theme. The activities outlined in this project compliment and leverage CSMI activities and are consistent with Lake Michigan LAMP objectives (subgoal 3, LAMP 2004). Most importantly, this project provides for objective decision-support tools for adaptive management and effectiveness of restoration action. Data from this project are integrated into the USGS data management system and provided to state cooperators and the Region 5 database for indicator bacteria consistent with EPA's sanitary surveys. Robust statistical analyses will help assess unexplained error leading to greater confidence in data interpretation. The project's primary goal, ultimately, is to assess the effectiveness of GLRI and federal goals toward restoration of selected and related degraded beach areas and determine their resiliency to climate change. Additionally, this project overlaps with the Nearshore Health, AOC, Watersheds, Environmental and Human Health, and Habitat and Species Science themes. This project also meets several of the strategic directions defined in the USGS Science Strategy including: 1) understanding and predicting ecosystem change, 2) assessment of the resiliency of ecosystems to adverse land change, hazards, and climate change, and 3) the role of environment and wildlife in human health, specifically pathogens in recreational water.<h4>Products</h4>Several scientific journal articles are planned as a part of this project including: 1) A paper on hydrodynamic and water quality changes relative to restoration efforts at 63rd and Jeorse Park Beach. 2) A paper on evaluation of changes in fecal indicator bacteria at the three beaches using pre- and post-condition assessment. 3) A paper on the use of bird and microbial community diversity in assessing beach conditions. The latter may include bird pathogens and the potential for zoonotic transfer. 4) A paper on the success of GLRI funded predictive modeling will be considered. Each of these papers will take the perspective of past conditions, immediate and long term improvement with special emphasis on climate change, sedimentation, and maintenance.<h4>Approach</h4>This project integrates intensive monitoring of physical, biological, chemical, geological, and social data to understand nearshore and coastal processes affecting restoration efforts at each study site. The success of restoration-related best management practices at each site are evaluated using annual monitoring data, data archives, numerical and empirical models, and understanding of the nearshore and coastal processes at these sites.<h4>References</h4>Relevant Links: Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Action Plan II (https://www.glri.us/actionplan/pdfs/glri-action-plan-2.pdf) U.S. Army Corp of Engineers 63rd Street Beach Restoration Page (http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works-Projects/63rd-Street-Dune/) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Lake Michigan Management Plans (https://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/lake-michigan-lamps) Natural Resources Defense Council Testing the Waters 2014 (https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ttw2014.pdf) Coordinated Science and Monitoring Initiative (http://www.regions.noaa.gov/great-lakes/index.php/great_lakes-restoration-initiative/accountability/lake-huron-coordinated-science-and-monitoring-initiative/) Related publications: Jackson, P.R., 2013, Circulation, mixing, and transport in nearshore Lake Erie in the vicinity of Villa Angela Beach and Euclid Creek, Cleveland, Ohio, September 11–12, 2012: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2013–5198, 34 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20135198.

       "  'title': 'New Strategies for Restoring Coastal Wetland Function, Maumee River Area of Concern',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are focusing on restoring natural water flow and ecological processes between coastal wetlands in the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (Ohio) and adjacent to Lake Erie to improve fish and wildlife habitat. This pilot project will develop approaches that will restore coastal wetland function and increase ecosystem resilience to be used as a model throughout the Great Lakes basin. USGS will focus on restoring natural hydrologic processes in diked coastal wetlands adjacent to Great Lakes waters to improve wetland functions like phosphorus retention and restoration of habitats for fish and wildlife. Sustainable approaches are being developed in the Maumee River Area of Concern (AOC) to restore the hydrology and other processes that drive coastal wetland functions and increase ecosystem resiliency. Results will be evaluated within an adaptive management framework and integrated with similar sites in the Saginaw River/Bay AOC and throughout the Great Lakes basin. Since the connection to the wetland was restored, the abundance and diversity of fish using the wetland habitats has exploded. Northern pike and other recreationally and commercially valued species are again using the 40 ha wetland for reproduction and feeding. Bird usage by waterfowl and several listed species is extensive. Preliminary water-quality data indicate that the water exiting the wetland back into the Maumee River AOC had significantly less phosphorus and other nutrients than the incoming water, which has very positive implications for the water quality BUI for the Maumee River AOC. Additional samples taken through FY 2013 will characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of fish use, nutrient retention, and other important wetland processes. Coordinated efforts with the coastal wetland monitoring program, data collection efforts identified in Remedial Action Plans, NOAA-funded habitat restoration projects, and The Nature Conservancy to help guide regional restoration strategies and maximize basin-wide impact of locally-important projects.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The reconnected wetland continues to be a sink for phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment from Crane Creek. High levels of sediment and nutrient retention (~50%) have been observed during the passage of storm or flood events that move large quantities of water into the wetland. These data show the potential water quality improvements associated with this type of wetland restoration and provide baseline data that can be used to promote further restoration efforts in the Maumee AOC and other Great Lakes coastal areas.<br> <br> The results of this study have led to further wetland reconnection projects throughout the Great Lakes basin. Numerous GLRI projects have included water-control or fish-passage structures as a direct result of our work, and the ongoing monitoring at ONWR has helped shape wetland management decisions regionally. Although focused on the Crane Creek coastal wetland complex from 2010-2012, the results of this work are influencing regional management and restoration decisions and supporting expanded landscape-level analyses in 2013.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Fish diversity and abundance in the restored wetland has increased dramatically in the two years since reconnection. The wetland has been acting as a nursery and breeding grounds for many species including: northern pike (Esox lucius), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), white and black crappies (Pomoxis spp.), and numerous species of sunfish (Lepomis spp.). High resolution sonar data have shown that fish access the wetland at all times of the day from late winter to late autumn. Data on fish species richness and abundance changes could be used to identify progress toward delisting of the “Degraded Fish and Wildlife Population” BUI in Maumee River AOC. Discussions with Ohio EPA and Partners for Clean Streams are helping guide analysis of existing data and data collection strategies in 2013.<br> <br> Invasive common carp were effectively excluded from the restored wetland habitat during their destructive spawning stages through the use of specially designed gates in the water control structure. By using an established bar width and excluding mature breeding size carp, integrated pest management approaches were applied to limit the risk of damage by invasive carp while still allowing northern pike and other native fish to pass into the wetlands. Similar technologies are being included in many other GLRI-funded coastal wetland restoration projects in western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron.<br> <br> Waterfowl and piscivorous bird usage of the wetland increased after being reconnected to Lake Erie. The availability of wetland habitat was crucial in 2012 when low water levels stranded some coastal wetlands and drought conditions contributed to dry conditions in many diked wetlands in the area. However, the reconnected wetland held water throughout the summer and was used extensively by migrating waterfowl in the autumn.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> A <strong>model</strong>&nbsp;was developed to estimate total phosphorus and total sediment loads to the reconnected wetland using high frequency turbidity and discharge measurements. This allows for more accurate estimates of nutrient and sediment retention in the wetland and can serve as a foundation for the development of similar models applicable at larger scales.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> The first objective of this project is to restore Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River through development of new and innovative restoration techniques and evaluation of multiple salmon strains to determine their suitability for restoration. A primary focus of Atlantic salmon restoration is to evaluate survival of new strains of salmon stocked into Lake Ontario. As part of this project, the Sebago strain is being stocked into the lake and other strains are being considered for use based on life history characteristics and egg availability. This approach includes acquisition of Atlantic salmon eggs, rearing of salmon to various life stages (fry, fingerlings, smolts), marking, and post-stocking evaluation. The UV treatment facility at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science has allowed researchers to acquire and rear Atlantic salmon eggs collected from the wild without risk of disease transfer, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Scientists have identified salmon release locations with the highest probability for success of capturing returning adult salmon, a critical part of establishing a Lake Ontario egg source to perpetuate the project. The first releases of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario have already occurred, with additional releases planned in the near future.<br> <br> The second objective of this project is to restore deepwater cisco and lake herring in Lake Ontario through development of new and innovative restoration techniques and evaluation of the suitability of historic spawning sites. Deepwater cisco and lake herring were once among the most abundant fish in Lake Ontario, serving as important prey for native salmon and lake trout, and supporting commercial fisheries. Lake Ontario populations of deepwater cisco and lake herring declined by the mid-1900s due to invasive species, and deepwater cisco went extinct from the lake by the 1970s, although populations still persisted in the upper Great Lakes (lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron). Restoration of deepwater cisco and lake herring in Lake Ontario has previously been hampered by an inability to obtain eggs from the upper Great Lakes for reintroduction into Lake Ontario, due to the lack of an isolation facility for rearing the eggs. The new UV treatment facility at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science now allows researchers to overcome this obstacle. Deepwater cisco and lake herring eggs from stocks in the upper Great Lakes were acquired at the start of this project, and the first releases of these important native fishes into Lake Ontario have already occurred. All stocked fish were marked with an elastomer dye, which allows researchers to evaluate post-stocking success. Restoration of lake herring is also focusing on current suitability and enhancement potential of historic spawning grounds.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Restoration of Atlantic salmon, deepwater cisco, and lake herring will require, at least for the short-term (10-20 years), stocking of hatchery-raised fish, which entails a cooperative, international effort among federal, state, and provincial agencies. Through GLRI funding, a new UV treatment facility was constructed at the USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science, providing state-of-the-art capabilities for holding wild-captured eggs and raising fish for release. Reintroduction of Atlantic salmon will provide greater fishing opportunities in Lake Ontario and restore the natural balance of the Lake Ontario food web through providing additional top predators. Reintroduction of the native prey fish species, deepwater cisco and lake herring, will increase food choices and enhance the natural recruitment potential of predator fish, including Atlantic salmon and lake trout. Restoration of native fish is also expected to mitigate previous effects of invasive species, such as alewife and rainbow smelt, and reduce opportunities for new invasive species to colonize the lake by increasing food web resistance to invasion.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Reintroduction of Atlantic salmon will provide greater fishing opportunities in Lake Ontario and restore the natural balance of the Lake Ontario food web through providing additional top predators.

Approximately 138,000 fall fingerling Atlantic salmon were raised and released in Lake Ontario tributaries during fall of 2011 and 2012. Another 15,000 fall fingerling Atlantic salmon were released in St. Lawrence River tributaries during fall of 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe. An additional 10,000 yearling Atlantic salmon smolts were released in Lake Ontario tributaries during spring 2012.<br> <br> Deepwater cisco eggs were collected in February 2012 from Lake Michigan. Approximately 1,200 fall fingerling deepwater cisco were stocked in Lake Ontario off Oswego, New York during fall of 2012. Collaborative efforts between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science resulted in collection of approximately 70 adult lake herring in Lake Ontario during winter of 2011-12. The USGS Tunison Lab raised and stocked approximately 10,000 fall fingerling lake herring in Lake Ontario embayments during winter of 2012-13. Post-stocking monitoring will occur to evaluate restoration success.<br> &nbsp;',\n",

AFINCH provides a basis for integrating monthly flow data from streamgages, water-use data, monthly climatic data, and land-cover characteristics to estimate natural monthly water yields from catchments by user-defined regression equations. Images of monthly water yields for active streamgages are generated in AFINCH and provide a basis for detecting anomalies in water yields, which may be associated with undocumented flow diversions or augmentations. Water yields are multiplied by the drainage areas of the corresponding catchments to estimate monthly flows. Flows from catchments are accumulated downstream through the streamflow network described by the stream segments. For stream segments where streamgages are active, ratios of measured to accumulated flows are computed. These ratios are applied to upstream water yields to proportionally adjust estimated flows to match measured flows. Flow is conserved through the NHDPlus network. A time series of monthly flows can be generated for stream segments that average about 1-mile long, or monthly water yields from catchments that average about 1 square mile. Estimated monthly flows can be displayed within AFINCH, examined for nonstationarity, and tested for monotonic trends. Monthly flows also can be used to estimate flow-duration characteristics at stream segments. AFINCH generates output files of monthly flows and water yields that are compatible with ArcMap, a geographical information system analysis and display environment. Chloropleth maps of monthly water yield and flow can be generated and analyzed within ArcMap by joining NHDPlus data structures with AFINCH output. Matlab code for the AFINCH application is presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) will identify through this project significant sources and impacts of historical and newly emerging toxics to the Great Lakes ecosystem through broad surveillance as well as laboratory and field research of tree swallows and other bird species. USGS scientists will determine the amount of exposure to and the effects of historical and emerging contaminants in Great Lakes food chains. The data will inform regulators and provide guidance on removal of Beneficial Use Impairments at Area of Concern sites around the Great Lakes. Work supported under this project is quantifying exposure to, and effects of, both historical and emerging contaminants on Great Lakes food chains using sentinel indicator species such as colonial waterbirds and tree swallows. Results will contribute directly to assessments of Great Lakes ecosystem health and science-based decision making, provide data that will be directly used by States and EPA to assess whether specific BUIs can be removed and AOC?s subsequently delisted, provide a baseline for future trend analysis, and determine the effectiveness of recent remediation actions at AOCs and other known hotspots. The tree swallow data provide for a biological matrix that is consistent across all AOCs and allows direct comparisons among AOCs and comparisons to non-AOC locations across not only the Great Lakes, but also the northern tier of states in the U.S. as well as Canada. Because swallows can be enticed to nest at AOCs with the use of nest boxes, similar data will be available for all AOCs. Because there are effects thresholds already established for tree swallows, or other avian species, it can be determined directly whether exposures to contaminants of various chemical classes are at or above levels of concern. The collection of colonial waterbird data, where those species occur, in conjunction with the tree swallow data, will allow for modeling and assessment of possible contaminant effects throughout the aquatic ecosystem. The limited feeding radius of swallows and close ties to sediment contamination allow for an assessment of the biological availability of sediment contaminants as well as quantification of changes in sediment contamination that will be directly usable by EPA in remedy effectiveness assessments.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> This information on effects of those chemical contaminants is directly applicable to two Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) for wildlife and is being used by States and EPA in their BUI assessments and reports. This information can also be used by decision makers to further prioritize watersheds for restoration, and is providing important metrics to measure the success of restoration and remediation activities that are ongoing or planned. Comparisons among sites, as well as to sites across the U.S. and Canada, will allow for better and more rigorous assessments of the effects of chemical contaminants on the health of the Great Lakes as a whole and at individual AOCs. This project is being conducted in close collaboration with EPA, NOAA, FWS, and State governments. By the end of this project, the resulting data set will be among the most comprehensive available for avian contaminants in a specific geographic region. A partnership has been initiated among EPA (ORD, Cincinnati, OH); USGS, Fort Collins, CO; and USGS, UMESC, WI to evaluate trophic level responses to PCB contamination at two AOCs (Manistique, MI and Ottawa River, OH). This partnership will enhance our ability to project exposure and effects throughout the food web and to provide additional information and techniques applicable to other AOCs.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Work funded during the first 3 years of the study has provided valuable and heretofore unavailable information, quantifying the distribution of both organic and inorganic contaminants in the same matrix (tree swallow eggs) across all AOCs and nearby reference areas. To date, detailed information has been collected at 45 study sites encompassing AOCs across all Great Lakes. EPA scientists (ORD, Athens, GA) completed metabolomic analyses of tree swallow tissues collected in 2011 by Project 80. Organic analyses from 2012 collections were completed and results are being converted to usable formats. Preliminary summaries of 2012 information have been made available to State AOC coordinators and public advisory organizations including the Fox River/Green Bay AOC, Waukegan AOC, Niagara River AOC, Menominee River AOC, Saginaw River AOC, Manistique River AOC, and Sheboygan River AOC<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> The <strong>web site</strong> established for GLRI Project 80: ( <a href=\\\\\"http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/wildlife_toxicology/glri_project80.html\\\\\">http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/wildlife_toxicology/glri_project80.html</a>).<br> <br> A <strong>summary </strong>of Project 80 results was presented on the Huron-Erie Corridor Research vessel meeting in August 2012.

       "  'abstract': 'These data were collected as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) project template 678-1 entitled \\\\\"Evaluate immediate and long-term BMP effectiveness of GLRI restoration efforts at urban beaches on Southern and Western Lake Michigan\\\\\". This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of two-dimensional, near-surface point measurements of basic water-quality parameters in coastal Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach at Gary, Indiana, on September 21, 2016. Water-quality parameters include temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total chlorophyll, and phycocyanin concentration. These data were collected using an EXO2 multiparameter sonde (SN 16F100255) equipped with a version 2 handheld display with a built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (SN 16N999907), temperature/conductivity probe (SN 16C104865), pH sensor (SN 15M100825), optical dissolved oxygen sensor (SN 15L101706), turbidity sensor (SN 16D100455), total algae phycocyanin smart sensor (SN 16C103752), central wiper, and depth sensor. The sonde was deployed off the starboard side of a manned survey vessel using a fixed aluminum mount at a depth of approximately 1.6 feet below the water surface. All parameters were sampled at 1-second intervals as the vessel completed the survey of the nearshore zone. The resulting dataset allows for analysis of the two-dimensional distributions of near-surface water-quality parameters in Lake Michigan at Jeorse Park Beach.',\n",

During 2010–12, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) worked with 23 local and State agencies to improve existing operational beach nowcast systems at 4 beaches and expand the use of predictive models in nowcasts at an additional 45 beaches throughout the Great Lakes. The predictive models were specific to each beach, and the best model for each beach was based on a unique combination of environmental and water-quality explanatory variables. The variables used most often in models to predict Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations or the probability of exceeding a State recreational water-quality standard included turbidity, day of the year, wave height, wind direction and speed, antecedent rainfall for various time periods, and change in lake level over 24 hours. During validation of 42 beach models during 2012, the models performed better than the current method to assess recreational water quality (previous day's E. coli concentration). The USGS will continue to work with local agencies to improve nowcast predictions, enable technology transfer of predictive model development procedures, and implement more operational systems during 2013 and beyond.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> To achieve a better understanding of seasonal habitats and migratory behaviors of Asian carp, we will conduct studies using telemetry, sonar and conventional fish sampling to determine 1) if, when, and where Asian carp congregate, 2) habitat overlap between Asian carp and native fishes, especially native filter-feeding fishes and potential predators, and 3) the suitability of large rivers and tributaries for spawning by Asian carp. We will also assess feeding behaviors by sampling food particles from areas with telemetry-tagged fish, at random sites and in Asian carp stomachs. Food from these sources will be characterized with a particle analyzer, genetics and microscopy to determine preferences and limitations in regards to particle size, shape, and algae and zooplankton composition. To determine environmental conditions that might affect recruitment of Asian carp, we will assess larval and juvenile Asian carp habitat needs and potential predators by sampling with electrofishing boats, nets, and remote sensing (use of pit-tags and telemetry) in managed and natural flood-plain wetlands. Stomach samples from potential predators will be analyzed with microscopy and genetics to determine whether they ingest Asian carp. Potential predators identified from field studies will be evaluated in controlled experiments to assess relative predator effectiveness and juvenile Asian carp habitat selection under various environmental conditions of predator density, depth, turbidity, and vegetation abundance.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> Information from these studies will fill gaps in and refine existing knowledge on the life cycle of Asian carps in North America that will speed the development of safe and effective control measures in systems with established and emerging Asian carp populations. The control measures developed with this new information will target specific life stages of Asian carp and include species-specific chemical controls, selective removal by fishing, barriers at strategic locations, lethal egg and larvae settling zones, artificial (false) spawning sites near existing egg and larvae settling zones, predator stocking, and other habitat manipulations detrimental to recruitment.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> <ul> <li>Larval and Juvenile sampling in 2014 occurred in shallow water habitats of the Mississippi River - Pool 19, Illinois River and Lower Missouri</li> <li>Asian carp larval presence confirms reproduction in all three populations</li> <li>Early life stages of Asian carps occupied different habitats, as larvae were present in deeper (100 cm) pelagic waters whereas juveniles occupied shallower (50 cm) open waters with little aquatic vegetation</li> <li>Largemouth bass and shortnose gar, potential native predators on Asian carp, were the most abundant predators that occupied the same habitats as Asian carp.</li> <li>Several other native predators were also sympatric with Asian carp and included bowfin, channel catfish, freshwater drum, white bass and various centrarchids</li> </ul> <h4>Products</h4> Hayer, C-A., DC Chapman, CG Byrd. 2015.

       "  'abstract': \"Asian carp are migrating towards the Great Lakes and are threatening to invade this ecosystem, hence there is an immediate need to control their population. The transport of Asian carp eggs in potential spawning rivers is an important factor in its life history and recruitment success. An understanding of the transport, development, and fate of Asian carp eggs has the potential to create prevention, management, and control strategies before the eggs hatch and develop the ability to swim. However, there is not a clear understanding of the hydrodynamic conditions at which the eggs are transported and kept in suspension. This knowledge is imperative because of the current assumption that suspension is required for the eggs to survive. Herein, FluEgg (Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator), a three-dimensional Lagrangian model capable of evaluating the influence of flow velocity, shear dispersion and turbulent diffusion on the transport and dispersal patterns of Asian carp eggs is presented. The model's variables include not only biological behavior (growth rate, density changes) but also the physical characteristics of the flow field, such as mean velocities and eddy diffusivities. The performance of the FluEgg model was evaluated using observed data from published flume experiments conducted in China with water-hardened Asian carp eggs as subjects. FluEgg simulations show a good agreement with the experimental data. The model was also run with observed data from the Sandusky River in Ohio to provide a real-world demonstration case. This research will support the identification of critical hydrodynamic conditions (e.g., flow velocity, depth, and shear velocity) to maintain eggs in suspension, assist in the evaluation of suitable spawning rivers for Asian carp populations and facilitate the development of prevention, control and management strategies for Asian carp species in rivers and water bodies.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>The ability of planktivorous fishes to exert top-down control on Bythotrephes potentially has far-reaching impacts on aquatic food-webs, given previously described effects of Bythotrephes on zooplankton communities. We estimated consumption of Bythotrephes by planktivorous and benthivorous fishes, using bioenergetics and daily ration models at nearshore (18 m), intermediate (46 m), and offshore (110 m) depths along one western Lake Superior transect (April, and September-November) and two northern Lake Michigan transects (April, July, September). In Lake Superior, consumption (primarily by cisco Coregonus artedi) exceeded Bythotrephes production at all offshore sites in September-November (up to 396% of production consumed) and at the intermediate site in November (842%) with no evidence of consumption nearshore. By comparing Bythotrephes biomass following months of excessive consumption, we conservatively concluded that top-down control was evident only at the offshore site during September-October. In Lake Michigan, consumption by fishes (primarily alewife Alosa pseudoharengus) exceeded production at nearshore sites (up to 178%), but not in deeper sites (&lt; 15%). Evidence for top-down control in the nearshore was not supported, however, as Bythotrephes never subsequently declined. Using generalized additive models, temperature, and not fish consumption, not zooplankton prey density, best explained variability in Bythotrephes biomass. The non-linear pattern revealed Bythotrephes to increase with temperature up to 16 °C, and then decline between 16 and 23 °C. We discuss how temperature likely has direct negative impacts on Bythotrephes when temperatures near 23 °C, but speculate that predation also contributes to declining biomass when temperatures exceed 16 °C.</p>',\n",

With an integrated mapping component to determine the geographic orientation of the beach, the software can automatically decompose wind/current/wave speed and magnitude information into along-shore and onshore/offshore components for use in subsequent analyses. Data can be examined using simple scatter plots to evaluate relationships between the response and independent variables (IVs). VB<sub>3</sub> can produce interaction terms between the primary IVs, and it can also test an array of transformations to maximize the linearity of the relationship The software includes search routines for finding the \\\\\"best\\\\\" models from an array of possible choices. Automated censoring of statistical models with highly correlated IVs occurs during the selection process.

This project is evaluating the effectiveness of projects that are closely associated with restoration of local habitat and contact recreational activities at two GLRI funded sites in Southern Lake Michigan and one non-GLRI site in Western Lake Michigan. Evaluation of GLRI projects will assess whether goals of recipients are on track and identify any developing unforeseen consequences. Including a third, non-GLRI project site in the evaluation allows comparison between restoration efforts in GLRI and non-GLRI funded projects. Projections and potential complications associated with climate change impacts on restoration resiliency are also being assessed. Two of the three sites to receive evaluation represent some of the most highly contaminated beaches in the United States and include restoration BMPs which could benefit urban beaches and nearshore areas throughout the Great Lakes. The urban beaches chosen for evaluation are at various stages of the restoration process and located in Indiana (Jeorse Park Beach), Illinois (63rd Street Beach), and Wisconsin (North Beach). Evaluation of effectiveness of restoration efforts and resiliency to climate change at urban beaches will provide vital information on the success of restoration efforts and identify potential pitfalls that will help maximize success of future GLRI beach and nearshore restoration projects. Data used for evaluation include continuous monitoring and synoptic mapping of nearshore currents, bathymetry, and water quality to examine nearshore transport under a variety of conditions. In addition, biological evaluations rely upon daily indicator bacteria monitoring, microbial community and shorebird surveys, recreational usage, and other ancillary water quality data. The pre- and post-restoration datasets comprised of these physical, chemical, biological, geological, and social data will allow restoration success to be evaluated using a science-based approach with quantifiable measures of progress. These data will also allow the evaluation of the resiliency of these restoration efforts under various climate change scenarios using existing climate change predictions and models. This data release is comprised of continuous measurements of nearshore currents in Lake Michigan at 63rd Street Beach at Jackson Park at Hyde Park, Illinois (USGS 04092440). Currents were measured and averaged over 10-minute intervals using a Teledyne RDI 600 kHz ChannelMaster acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) mounted to the north end of the breakwater wall and oriented 60 degrees from true North. The ADVM was configured with a 6-meter blanking distance, ten 8 meter measurement cells, and a total profiling distance of 86 meters from the face of the instrument. The average depth of the transducers below the water surface was approximately 2.7 meters and the physical coordinates of the instrument in the Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16N WGS84 projection are 452834.7 meters East, 4626018.5 meters North. The instrument was deployed on May 19, 2016 and recovered on November 1, 2016.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '<p>Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) concentrations in beach water have been used for many years as a criterion for closing beaches due to potential health concerns. Yet, current understanding of sources and transport mechanisms that drive FIB occurrence remains insufficient for accurate prediction of closures at many beaches. Murphy Park Beach, a relatively pristine beach on Green Bay in Door County, Wis., was selected for a study to evaluate FIB sources and transport mechanisms. Although the relatively pristine nature of the beach yielded no detection of pathogenic bacterial genes and relatively low FIB concentrations during the study period compared with other Great Lakes Beaches, its selection limited the number of confounding FIB sources and associated transport mechanisms. The primary sources of FIB appear to be internal to the beach rather than external sources such as rivers, storm sewer outfalls, and industrial discharges. Three potential FIB sources were identified: sand, swash-zone groundwater, and <i>Cladophora</i> mats. Modest correlations between FIB concentrations in these potential source reservoirs and FIB concentrations at the beach from the same day illustrate the importance of understanding transport mechanisms between FIB sources and the water column. One likely mechanism for transport and dispersion of FIB from sand and <i>Cladophora</i> sources appears to be agitation of <i>Cladophora</i> mats and erosion of beach sand due to storm activity, as inferred from storm indicators including turbidity, wave height, current speed, wind speed, sky visibility, 24-hour precipitation, and suspended particulate concentration. FIB concentrations in beach water had a statistically significant relation (p-value ‹0.05) with the magnitude of these storm indicators. In addition, transport of FIB in swash-zone groundwater into beach water appears to be driven by groundwater recharge associated with multiday precipitation and corresponding increased swash-zone groundwater discharge at the beach, as indicated by an increase in the specific conductance of beach water. Understanding the dynamics of FIB sources (sand, swash-zone groundwater, and <i>Cladophora</i>) and transport mechanisms (dispersion and erosion from storm energy, and swash-zone groundwater discharge) is important for improving predictions of potential health risks from FIB in beach water.</p>',\n",

During an outbreak investigation, blood collected from bird carcasses is tested for the presence of BoNT/E using the mouse lethality assay. While sensitive, this method is labor-intensive and low throughput and can take up to 7 days to complete. We developed a rapid and sensitive in vitro assay, the BoTest Matrix E assay, that combines immunoprecipitation with high-affinity endopeptidase activity detection by F??rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to rapidly quantify BoNT/E activity in avian blood with detection limits comparable to those of the mouse lethality assay. On the basis of the analysis of archived blood samples (n = 87) collected from bird carcasses during avian mortality investigations, BoTest Matrix E detected picomolar quantities of BoNT/E following a 2-h incubation and femtomolar quantities of BoNT/E following extended incubation (24 h) with 100% diagnostic specificity and 91% diagnostic sensitivity. ?? 2011, American Society for Microbiology.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ensuring environmentally responsible application of piscicides (fish poisons) in rivers by using real-time dye tracking',\n",
       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Two large-scale and complex applications of rotenone (a fish poison) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) occurred in 2009 and 2010 to combat invasive Asian. Rotenone is a fish toxicant that targets gill-breathing organisms by inhibiting respiration and breaks down quickly in the environment. In December 2009, rotenone was applied in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) at multiple stations through a 6.2-mile reach of the canal near Lockport, Illinois. The rotenone was being applied as a precautionary measure during maintenance of the electric fish barrier in place to keep the Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. Tracking the movement of the rotenone is critical to time the addition of the deactivation chemical to neutralize the toxin. The rotenone plume was encased in Rhodamine WT dye (red in color) so that two survey boats provided real-time feedback to shore personnel regarding the plume extent as it traveled downstream. Real-time tracking of the rotenone was essential in this large-scale application because of the multistage injection strategy and the numerous deactivation points required to minimize collateral damage to fisheries in surrounding and receiving water bodies. A second application of rotenone in May 2010 to the Little Calumet River near O’Brien Lock and Dam (Illinois) provided another opportunity for dye-tracking support operations. In this case, dye was injected at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the rotenone application to track movement of water in and out of a treatment area. This dye tracking allowed proper deactivation to occur and avoided unnecessary damage to fisheries downstream. The data collected during the real-time tracking operations for both rotenone applications is fully documented providing valuable information for future applications.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Relevance &amp; Impact</h4> The methods developed for real-time tracking of piscicides are applicable to tracking virtually any application of toxins or other chemicals used to combat Asian carp or other invasive species. In addition, the methods should prove to be equally successful for tracking of pollutants, contaminants, or water masses in rivers, lakes, and coastal environments.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Key Findings</h4> Real-time tracking of piscicides can be successfully accomplished, even in water bodies with complex hydrodynamics, using Rhodamine WT dye and surveillance/tracking boats. Such methods minimize collateral damage to fisheries downstream and ensure the toxins are applied in an environmentally responsible manner.<br> &nbsp; <h4>Products</h4> Jackson, P.R., Lageman, J.D., 2014, Real-time piscicide tracking using Rhodamine WT dye for support of application, transport, and deactivation strategies in riverine environments: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2013–5211, 43 p., <a href=\\\\\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20135211\\\\\">http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20135211</a>.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Habitat suitability was estimated for invasive Phragmites in the coastal Great Lakes region (shoreline to 10 km inland).  These estimates were based on current distribution patterns and environmental conditions.  Phragmites presence or absence was defined based on a distribution map produced by cooperative research between the GLSC and Michigan Technical Research Institute.  Environmental variables were processed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) and came from existing publicly available sources.  Variables include descriptors of soils, nutrients, topography, ecoregion, anthropogenic disturbance, and climate.  Environmental conditions and Phragmites presence/absence were sampled in a GIS at points established at systematic 100-m intervals across the study area.Habitat suitability was estimated for Phragmites at each systematic sample location.  A correlative ecological niche model (boosted regression trees) was used to produce a continuous probabilistic index that ranged between zero and one.  This index was rescaled in to six categories of relative habitat suitability by specifying a threshold for suitable/unsuitable conditions where the proportion of presence locations classified as suitable equated to the proportion of absence locations classified as unsuitable.  After applying this threshold, the data ranges classified as suitable/unsuitable were split at equal increments to result in six categories of relative suitability.',\n",

They are included here to show the available horizontal extent of lidar-derived topo-bathymetric data and thus explicitly identify gaps and limitations of predicted corridor extents under various reduced lake level scenarios. In addition, these files provide users with a background layer that depicts the topographic variability of the submerged near-shore lake bed and terrestrial landscape.These files are 5m grid representations of the hydrographic and topographic data collected by the CHARTS system along the coasts of the U.S. sides of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario as part of the National Coastal Mapping Program. Similar data exist for portions of the Lake Superior coastal zone, but are not viewable on the interactive maps associated with this online resourse.The 5m grid representation of the data are based on the ASCII xyz files containing the hydrographic data and the topographic last return (TL) data. An example file name is \\\\\"2007_NCMP_MI_Huron_47_5mGrid.tif .\\\\\" The data file names are based on the year, project, area name, box number, and product type. Data were collected from 2006 to 2010, and for multiple dates along portions of the above listed lakes\\' coastal zones as well as their connecting channels.  These data do not represent spatially complete contiguous coverages along the entire coast, and are limited where turbidity or aquatic vegetation prevented light penetration through the water column when flights were conducted.Where multiple date data were available, the year\\'s data whose bathymetric coverage were most complete were used preferentially as the primary year, and the alternate year\\'s data were used to fill any gaps imposed by turbidity or aquatic vegetation in the primary year. In these cases, the tiles file name reflects the two years\\' coincident data, with the first year listed in the file name representing the primary year selected.The data were collected and processed in geographic coordinates and ellipsoid heights. The positions are provided relative to NAD83 in decimal degrees of longitude and latitude. The heights were converted from ellipsoid to orthometric heights (NAVD88) using NGS\\' Geoid03 model file \\\\\"g2003u08.bin\\\\\" with the results in meters. Once converted to orthometric heights, the data were then converted to IGLD85 using the VDatum program from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The goal of the National Ground Water Monitoring Network (NGWMN) is to provide information needed for planning, management, and development of ground-water supplies to meet current and future water needs and ecosystem requirements. This will be accomplished by aggregating suitable ground-water data from local, state, and federal organizations. A consensus-based framework document (http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html) was developed to provide guidance to ensure that the data are comparable and can be included in a nationally consistent network. The framework design focuses on providing information needed to assess the quantity of ground-water reserves as constrained by quality. The scale of the network will focus on Principal and Major Aquifers of the United States. Five Pilots tested the concepts outlined in the Framework document for the NGWMN. The Pilot areas were the Mahomet-Teays aquifer in Illinois and Indiana, the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer in southeastern Minnesota, and statewide aquifers in Montana, New Jersey, and Texas. A pilot Network portal was developed using data from the 5 pilots and included data contributed by 9 organizations. An important aspect of the Network portal is that the portal is not an aggregated database of data from all participants, but it is a gateway to the data as it is maintained and served by each participating organization. Original data are retrieved from each data provider by the portal in real time. The portal is capable of displaying water levels, well logs, and water quality in tabular or graphical formats and allows the user to bulk download all of the available data. Users may select water-level and water-quality wells by subnetwork and based on the Agency collecting the data or the Principal aquifer. Most wells are classified into \\\\\"Background\\\\\", \\\\\"Suspected/Anticipated Change\\\\\" or \\\\\"Known Changes\\\\\" subnetworks. Within these subnetworks, wells are categorized as either \\\\\"Trend\\\\\" or \\\\\"Surveillance\\\\\", based on the monitoring frequency.',\n",

Untreated water samples are collected weekly and analyzed at MOE labs. This program contributes to the assessment of taste and odor issues and the potential for algal toxin production in drinking water.

This program will allow Ohio to establish baseline conditions and track progress of GLRI and other efforts along Lake Erie. This effort also ties into Annex 11 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), which calls for a comprehensive surveillance and monitoring program for the Great Lakes to evaluate water quality trends, assess the effectiveness of remedial programs, measure compliance with jurisdictional regulatory programs, identify emerging problems and support development of RAPs and LaMPs. The monitoring strategy was designed over a three-year cycle to define environmental conditions in the dynamic nearshore areas.  Experience and data gathered will serve as the baseline to integrate annual Lake Erie monitoring into the State of Ohio’s Water Quality Monitoring Strategy.  The project builds on the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment framework by adding ambient sites and additional parameters, including plankton.  Subsequent years focus on harbors, bays and estuaries, as well as evaluation of biological communities at various trophic levels.  Ohio EPA completed the first round of sampling in 2011 and will continue additional sampling rounds in 2012 and 2013.  Results from the first two rounds of sampling will be summarized in Ohio EPA’s 2014 Integrated Report.',\n",

This narrative has been prepared to bring context to the work done by the Recreational Boating and Tourism Technical Working Group (TWG) of the International Upper Great Lakes Study. The Recreation Boating and Tourism TWG has identified four Performance Indicators (PI) to help better understand the effect water level changes in the Upper Great Lakes will have on recreational boating and tourism in the region. These PI’s are 1) Coastal Tourism; 2) Great Lakes Cruising; 3) Marinas; and 4) Boat launches. These indicators emerged as the most likely factors to be affected by change in Great Lakes’ water levels. Although other recreation indicators were considered, for example sport fishing, little evidence was found to suggest a connection between those factors and changes in Great Lakes’ water levels. The TWG has prepared reports on each of the Performance Indicators and this contextual narrative (CN) was written to bring context to those reports by describing the historical background, current situation and future trends of recreational boating and tourism in the Upper Great Lakes region.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Michigan Technological University maintains thermistor sensor chains deployed each year at the north and south entrances to the Keweenaw Waterway in Lake Superior. This station is North Entry to Keweenaw Waterway, 47.210397 N, -88.617426 W. Each thermistor chain includes six sensors spaced at 1-m intervals that collect water temperature data at depths of 1-6 m below the surface. The sensor chains were designed by Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) using Thermocron iButtons (model DS1921Z), temperature-sensitive resistors made of a semi-conductive material. Each iButton is enclosed in a 16 mm thick stainless steel can that is able to withstand the harsh conditions of Lake Superior. Following retrieval of the chains at the end of the season, temperature data are transferred from the iButton to a PC using a download wizard.

       "  'abstract': '<h4>Description of Work</h4> Past water-quality issues in the St. Lawrence River at Massena, NY resulted in a determination that selected beneficial uses may be impaired in a surrounding Area of Concern (AOC) and on the Canadian side of the international boundary (Cornwall, Ontario). The plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) Beneficial Use Impairment (BUI) was so designated because impairment metrics were unavailable or inconclusive. Recent investigations, however, suggest that plankton communities are relatively healthy and no longer threaten the local ecosystem. Thus, the BUI for plankton may now be outdated in all, or parts of, the St. Lawrence River in the Massena AOC. The primary goal for the Massena (and Cornwall) Remedial Action Plan (RAP) (developed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the Massena Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), the Canadian governments, the Cornwall Public Advisory Committee (PAC), and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe at Akwesasne) is to &quot;restore, protect, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the St. Lawrence River ecosystem and in particular the Akwesasne, Cornwall-Lake St.Francis and Massena Area of Concern in accordance with the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and other agency laws, regulations, and policies&quot;. The RAP established specific criteria in the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC for delisting (restoring and protecting) the &quot;Degradation of Phytoplanton and Zooplankton Populations&quot; BUI. These criteria are: (1) &quot;phytoplankton or zooplankton community structure does not significantly differ from unimpacted control sites of comparable physical and chemical characteristics&quot;, and (2) &quot;in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters (i.e. no growth inhibition)&quot;. This study generated toxicity data needed to test hypotheses that (1) waters at all sample locations in the AOC are not toxic to plankton and (2) the toxicity of waters at all sample locations in the AOC are no more toxic to plankton than are waters from upstream control reaches (in three selected main tributaries and in the St. Lawrence River), which are not within the AOC. Toxicity of waters to plankton from all study sites will be quantified by the (a) growth of the green algae species, Selenastrum capricornutum and (b) reproductive capacity (and survival) of Ceriodaphnia dubia using standard United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidelines. Statistical analyses that test both hypotheses will be used to determine if waters within the St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC meet the second criterion for delisting the plankton BUI. <br /> &nbsp;',\n",

The identified needs focused on items that could have been used to improve the Lake Superior regulation decisions within the IUGLS. The Coastal Zone TWG noted that a complimentary component of adaptive management is setting up systems and strategies to actually reduce vulnerabilities (as opposed to managing the hazard itself (i.e. water levels)). Since activities to reduce vulnerabilities are largely outside the control of the IJC, the white paper did not specifically address such adaptive management options.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The National Land Cover Database 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. An update to the original version was initiated when generation of NLCD 2006 data products identified some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. Questions about the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.',\n",

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \\\\\"farmed wetlands\\\\\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThe installation and management of dams threatens the diversity of native Great Lakes fish by restricting or eliminating connectivity between the lakes and critical spawning, nursery, and overwintering habitats. Tributaries also provide water, nutrients, and sediment to the Great Lakes, particularly to coastal and near-shore ecosystems. Although limitation of fish passage and denial of fish access to the upper watershed are important consequences of dams, these influences are difficult to quantify and so the influence of tributary dams as a stressor is limited in this analysis to those effects associated with altered delivery of sediments, nutrients and organic matter. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377. -http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSince the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, ballast water release from ocean vessels is the most probable vector for almost two-thirds of invasions, including some of the most notorious Great Lakes invaders such as zebra and quagga mussels and round gobies. Because of the importance of ballast water release as an invasion pathway, control measures have been enacted. Ballast water exchange (BWE), the exchange of fresh or estuarine water with sea water to purge or kill organisms in ballast tanks, has been required since 1993. Saltwater flushing instituted after 2006 further requires sea water rinsing of ballast tanks of Great Lake-bound ships. The effectiveness of these control measures remains a matter of debate, although the importance of ballast water as a pathway likely is diminishing. However, ballast discharges from ships confined to the Great Lakes account for 95% of all ballast water discharges and may facilitate the secondary transport of species that have already been introduced. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

PCBs were widely used as coolants and insulating fluids and in a variety of other industrial uses, but their manufacture and importation to North American ended in 1977-1980. As with other restricted legacy organochlorines, they are extremely resistant to degradation and persist for decades in the environment.

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThermoelectric power generation from coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, and biomass energy sources is the largest use of water in the Great Lakes basin (72% of all water use in 2005), with the majority of water used for plant cooling. Water intakes directly harm fish populations by impingement on water intake screens and entrainment when smaller fish passing through screens are harmed by contact with infrastructure or by heat shock. Cooling water intake locations can be as much as 500-1000 m offshore, suggesting that impingement and entrainment of fish can encompass an area of at least one km and possibly more. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

However, at the time water was simply pumped out of the Black River into the wooden pipes of the distribution system without treatment. A typhoid epidemic in 1893 was believed to have resulted from the lack of filtration. In 1896 construction of a water purification plant was authorized. Lorain became the first plant in the United States to start construction for the express purpose of filtering all the water to remove bacteria. The primary source for the potable water intake was switched to Lake Erie with the Black River intake as only a secondary source. Today, all water is drawn from a crib 26.5ft deep and 2,800 feet out in Lake Erie from outside the breakwall. A YSI EXO2 sonde is installed in the lake pump station for the city of Lorain, Ohio. The sensor is located approximately 6ft below the water surface and was installed on January 27, 2018 and is part of the GLOS Lake Erie HABs monitoring network.',\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgMining has the potential to introduce contaminants into lake waters and sediments, with documented impacts on aquatic life. We combine active and historic metal mines due to the potentially long legacy effect and often lesser regulatory restriction on historic metal mines. We also include limestone/dolomite mines, even though chemical leaching is not expected to be serious, because of the land disturbance associated with these mining operations and the large footprint of some mines. Calcite Quarry located in Rogers City, MI, on the shore of Lake Huron is the worlds largest limestone mine. Quarries for excavating sand, gravel and stones make up the vast majority of mines in the Great Lakes region, but they are not considered as a stressor here because they are unlikely to result in significant disturbance or contamination. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThe round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a bottom-dwelling fish whose native range in Eurasia. It was first observed in the St. Clair River, presumably a ballast water introduction, and is now widespread in all Great Lakes except Lake Superior where it is reported from only a few locations. It is especially abundant in Lakes Erie and Ontario. The round goby population of western Lake Erie was estimated at 9.9 billion individuals. The round goby preys on eggs and fry of other fish as well as benthic invertebrates. They frequent shallow waters.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

The WMO ice chart archiving formats are the Sea Ice Grid (SIGRID) format developed in 1981 and formalized in 1989 and its successor SIGRID-2. The National Ice Center digital Ice Analysis charts (Hemispheric, Regional and Daily are encoded in SIGRID-3 and have two main components: the shapefile containing the Ice Analysis ice information (ice polygons and related attributes) and the metadata describing the Ice Analysis data under the SIGRID-3 format. The National Ice Center legacy ice data set contains hemispheric spatial data files from 1972 through 2004 inclusive. Regional Spatial data files of the traditional \\\\\"seas\\\\\"(ex Beaufort Sea) have been available since 1997. Legacy data are available in various formats from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado ( http://nsidc.org/ ). Legacy Great Lakes charts are available from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan  ( http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/ ). Currently (October, 2006), spatial data files are available for each hemisphere, and for each sub-regional area, of which there are approximately 62.  The ice analyses for each sea or sub-sea are also available in a jpeg format.  They represent the ice conditions for the week in which they are published.  Data for the analyses can go back 96 hours from when they are completed. They are dated with the week they are published. They are based on an analysis and integration of all available data on ice conditions, including weather and oceanographic information, visual observations from shore, ship and aircraft, airborne radar, satellite imagery and climatological information. The Regional Ice Analyses describe areas of differing ice conditions using the WMO ice observing standards, and indicate where significant changes in the amount, stage of development and form of the predominant ice types have occurred. The Regional Ice Analyses for all of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere Seas are produced every other week. The analyses for the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, Arctic Basin (High Arctic), Northern East Greenland, Barents, Kara and White Seas and the Cook Inlet are produced at least weekly. The Ross Sea is produced weekly during Austral Summer navigation season. The Chesapeake and Delaware Bay areas are produced weekly when there is ice. The analyses for the Great Lakes (when there is ice and in collaboration with the Canadian Ice Service), the Bering Sea, the Cook Inlet and the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are produced twice per week when there is an ice edge present. The National Ice Center also produced daily ice edges in text format for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Warming Water Temperatures data set was created as part of a larger work, the Great Lakes Environment and Assessment Mapping (GLEAM) project. For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSummer surface water temperatures appear to be increasing across the Great Lakes basin, with greater increases in the upper relative to the lower Great Lakes. Moreover, summer water temperatures appear to be warming at a faster rate than mean annual air temperatures in the upper Great Lakes, evidently due to an earlier onset of summer stratification, which may last longer and become established at shallower depths. Model projections indicate surface temperature warming between 2000 and 2100 ranging from 0.37-0.93°C per decade in Lake Superior to between 0.20 and 0.60°C per decade in Lake Erie. Temperature changes will affect the metabolism of ectothermic organisms, alter the ranges and abundances of many species due to changes in thermal habitat, affect the timing of seasonal events such as spring blooms of algae, and promote the spread of nuisance algae and invasive species. Some changes may be beneficial, however, as warmer temperatures likely will increase ecosystem productivity unless nutrients or other factors become limiting, and may expand the thermal habitat available to some native fishes. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgGreat Lakes water levels have been relatively stable over the past 150 years, with only a 2 m difference between the recorded maximum monthly mean and the minimum monthly mean. Seasonally the lakes vary by 0.40 to 0.45 m. However, the Lakes have experienced considerable water level fluctuations in the past three decades relative to the 2-m range, with extreme high water in the 1970s-1990s. Lake levels dramatically declined between 1997 and 2000, and are now near their recorded low. Shallow, near-shore regions of the lakes, including wetlands and river mouths, are particularly vulnerable to declines in water levels, which may result in increased demand for dredging. Although short-term lake level fluctuations can be beneficial to wetland biodiversity, prolonged change is likely to cause zonation shifts, the consequences of which will depend in part on lake bathymetry.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

Such structures intercept and/or divert along-shore transport of sediments, potentially causing accumulation of sediments on the updrift side and sediment starvation on the downdrift side. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377. http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgThe USEPA and EC designated 43 AOCs under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a binational agreement to ensure the long-term maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes Ecosystem. Sediment contamination is the most common cause of AOC listing. AOCs range in size from those covering entire watersheds to portions of watersheds, segments of rivers, stretches of shoreline and individual bays and harbors. Generally, the AOCs are associated with a river mouth, and their area of influence in the lakes themselves is largely undefined. However, sediment contamination is generally localized at river mouths and harbor areas of human dominated watersheds, where fine-grained sediments have been deposited over time.  As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

Nitrogen input to the Great Lakes is represented by nitrate (+ nitrite), which typically comprises the majority of total inorganic nitrogen. Tributary nitrate loads were averaged for 1994-2008 except for Lake Erie, where tributary data were available only for 2005.

We focus on copper as an industrial metal of concern known to occur at elevated concentrations in the Great Lakes. Copper can be highly toxic at low concentrations to invertebrates and to fish in early life stages and can result in food web disruption. We mapped surficial sediment copper concentration from two data sources. Near-shore data points were obtained from collection of monitoring and restoration projects (as for mercury), while in-lake data values were provided by Environment Canada (EC). Data were kriged using ArcGIS algorithms with a 5-point neighborhood. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgChanges in winter ice cover may influence lake levels via evaporative water loss and lead to higher water temperatures by affecting the onset of summer warming. While the duration of winter ice cover has unquestionably decreased over the past century at locations including Grand Traverse Bay, MI, and Lake Superior in the vicinity of Bayfield, WI, trends across the surface of the Great Lakes are more complex. One measure, the annual maximum percentage of lake surface covered by ice, is highest in Lake Erie, despite having the fewest freezing degree days (FDDs), due to its shallow mean depth (19 m); Lake Superior ranks second, because its high FDDs offset its greater mean depth (148 m). Relative ranking for the five Great Lakes also has changed across decades. Although further analysis is needed, evidence to date and future projections suggest reductions in ice cover extent and duration characteristic of mild past winters, and Lakes Erie and Superior may show the greatest response.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \\\\\"provisional\\\\\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Land Cover (Version 2.0) for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. An update to the original version was initiated when generation of NLCD 2006 data products identified some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products. These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. Questions about the NLCD the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.',\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgRoads are considered a distinct stressor because they provide access to the lakeshore, including in less developed areas. Roads add to impervious surface area and alter the physical and chemical environment by contributing runoff polluted with road surface materials. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Phosphorus inputs to the Great Lakes are represented by TP, and include both tributary and atmospheric inputs.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors.

Using this approach, stations for water column sampling were selected from homogenous areas of each lake where routine variability in lake conditions would not likely mask actual changes.In addition to the routine monitoring stations, “master stations” have been identified in each major lake basin.  (Master stations are indicated with an “M” following the station ID.)  The routine monitoring stations are referred to as non-master stations.   Most of the current master stations represent the deepest point within its lake basin.  These stations are sampled at more frequent depths to provide GLNPO with a better means of characterizing vertical conditions during each survey.  Samples are taken annually at each spring sampling site (in open water) and analysis is done for the following parameters of relevance: TSS,particulate nitrogen,particulate phosphorus,TP,DRP,nitrates,Chlorophyll a, also TP and Tn in sediments.

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgAtlantic salmon, brown trout, Chinook salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout are all currently stocked in one or more of the Great Lakes. The stocking of non-native salmonines may provide vectors for disease and parasite introductions and for disease and parasite spread throughout the Great Lakes owing to the mobility of stocked salmonines. Further, non-native salmonines may compete with native fishes for food and spawning habitat and may cause excessive mortality to native prey and competitor species. On the other hand, stocked non-native salmonines are among the most effective controls of alewife and rainbow smelt abundances and have facilitated the recovery of native fishes in Lakes Huron and Michigan. Non-native salmonines also play a key role in the regional economy through support of profitable sport fisheries. Hence, non-native salmonine stocking plays an ambiguous ecological role with the potential to both harm native species and to facilitate rehabilitation of diminished, threatened, or extirpated native species.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

The internal limits of the watershed boundaries are scientifically defensible and valid, however, portions of the watershed polygon may have been modified to stay within the jurisdictional limit of the CA. There is the potential that the watershed polygons may have been modified (i.e., clipped) from the originally scientifically defensible boundary to make this dataset. The original watershed boundaries were defined as part of the Source Water Protection Areas delineation with MOE. For this dataset the following applies: The watershed boundaries represent a scientifically defensible delineation of Conservation Halton's watersheds using ArcHydro for analysis. This study was completed in October 2007 using primarily 2002 FBS data and represents the most recent delineation of watersheds. Adjoining catchments from the ArcHydro analysis to form watersheds and subwatershed for the reaches in Conservation Halton's jurisdiction. Catchment analysis was preformed with a 5 ha minimum drainage area on a DEM with a cell size of 5 m². The progression of feature creation for CH watersheds is as follows: ArcHydro delineated catchments are dissolved to delineate subwatersheds as per CH Subwatershed Studies which are then dissolved to represent individual watersheds (Bronte, Grindstone, etc.) within the jurisdiction of Conservation Halton. The catchment boundary limits with surrounding Conservation Authorities are still draft with respect to each other and are currently under review. Most boundary limits for Conservation Halton have been derived from hydrological surface modelling in ArcHydro. Please be advised that some boundary extents represent political boundaries rather than scientifically proven limits. All studies completed using this data at CH boundary limits should acquire the neighbouring CA boundary limit from the appropriate CA.\",\n",

The ultimate objective of MEC is to use the coupled models to produce operational forecasts. IP3 employs a configuration of MEC specialised for coupling land-surface and hydrological models, known as MEC – Surface and Hydrology or MESH. This system is the Canadian result of an intensive global research effort to couple atmospheric and hydrological models, in orer to improve hydrological flow simulations and atmospheric predictions in both climate- and weather-prediction models. The current versions of MEC and MESH include three land-surface schemes: •\\ta simple force-restore scheme •\\ta version of the Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) LSS •\\tthe Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS)',\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgInvasive common reed Phragmites australissubspeciesaustralisforms dense monocultures which crowd out native plants, inhibit animal movement, serve as a poor quality food for animals, and slow decomposition. In freshwater habitats, evidence suggests decreases in turtle, bird, and amphibian populations, plant diversity, nutrient cycling and microhabitat conditions. While several genotypes of P. australis(subspeciesamericanus) are native to North America, exotic genotypes (particularly haplotype M from Europe) have been present in the Great Lakes region since the 1910s and expanded rapidly starting in the 1960s, nearly entirely displacing the native genotypes. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Sea Lamprey data set was created as part of a larger work, the Great Lakes Environment and Assessment Mapping (GLEAM) project. For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgSea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) invaded Lake Ontario in the early 19thcentury and expanded throughout the Great Lakes in the mid-20thcentury. The sea lamprey is considered one of the most detrimental invasive species to enter the Great Lakes, and is known to parasitize lake trout, non-native salmonines, lake whitefish, lake herring, rainbow trout, burbot and walleye. Although the sea lamprey was not solely responsible for all population collapse of lake trout, it is currently a major impediment to lake trout rehabilitation efforts. The abundance and distribution of sea lampreys throughout the Great Lakes has not been determined. However, adults enter rivers to spawn, and spawning numbers are estimated from surveys and modeling. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Field monitoring and observations collected by GLERL researchers keep track of nutrients at six master stations and two fixed moorings in western Lake Erie. The information gained from the field monitoring and observation assists in the development of probabilistic models for Lake Erie, which will be used to predict the magnitude of algal blooms while taking into account seasonal factors.

       "  'abstract': \"The Great Backyard Bird Count is an annual four-day event that engages bird watchers of all levels in counting birds and reporting their results to create a mid-winter snapshot of the numbers, kinds, and distribution of birds across the continent. Participants count birds for as little or as long as they wish during the four-day period and tally the highest number of birds of each species that they see at any one time. At the Great Backyard Bird Count web site, they fill out an online checklist to submit their counts. As the count progresses, anyone with Internet access can explore what is being reported from their own towns or anywhere in the United States and Canada. They can also see how the current year's numbers compare with those from any of the previous years. Participants may also send in photographs of the birds they see. A selection of images is posted in the GBBC online photo gallery. After the count, scientists analyze the results and post summaries highlighting the year's trends and findings. The Great Backyard Bird Count is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Audubon, with sponsorship from Wild Birds Unlimited. +++++ This layer provides access to the raw bird data records in GML format and can take a very long time to process if the full dataset is requested.

       "  'abstract': \"The Aquaculture data set was created as part of a larger work, the Great Lakes Environment and Assessment Mapping (GLEAM) project. For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see: -Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.org Aquaculture is a growing industry in inland waters of the Great Lakes basin, but lake-based cage culture, which began in the mid to late 1980s, occurs only in Georgian Bay and North Channel of Lake Huron. Aquaculture can be detrimental to its immediate surrounding environment, affecting water quality via food byproducts and excreted waste from fish, leading to organic and nutrient enrichment and eutrophic conditions. Other potential problems include introduced diseases and parasites and antibiotic use. Because rainbow trout, although a non-native species, are already established in the Great Lakes, the most likely impact of trout aquaculture is through degradation of water quality. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) first appeared in the Great Lakes in Lake St. Clair in 1986, followed by quagga mussels (D. bugensis) in 1989. Dreissena colonization has resulted in a number of physical and chemical changes to the Great Lakes. Colonization adds habitat complexity for benthic invertebrates and creates a hard substrate in soft-sediment systems. Chemical impacts are complex and variable, as numerous studies have found dreissenid effects on total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate, turbidity and chlorophyll levels. When in high density, dreissenids appear to cause chlorophyll declines and shunt pelagic algal production into benthic mussel biomass, possibly reducing food availability to upper trophic levels and thus limiting fish productivity. In addition, dreissenids may facilitate growth of the nuisance algae Microcystis aeruginosaand Cladophora glomeratadue to increased water clarity, although the public may perceive greater underwater visibility as a benefit.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels.

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgHypoxia, commonly defined as dissolved oxygen levels (DO) at or below the 2-4 mg.L-1 range, occurs in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) of some highly productive regions of the Great Lakes. Hypoxia usually occurs during late summer due to the decomposition of organic matter leading to oxygen depletion. Human-induced nutrient enrichment, particularly from elevated phosphorus inputs, has increased the frequency and areal extent of hypoxia. Because DO > 4 mg.L-1is unlikely to be stressful to the majority of species, we estimated relative stress due to hypoxia using the continuous range of DO values and a scale from 1 (no stress, > 4 mg.L-1) to 0 (maximum stress, 0 mg/L).As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Coldwater Consulting created a new dataset for Lake and Cook Counties by delineating the entire shoreline, and classifying it by the Revised Numerics for Shoreline Classification Scheme (Stewart C.J., 2002), which includes both structure type and condition. This was performed through simultaneous use of Microsoft’s Bing aerial oblique imagery and ArcGIS with background imagery. Where appropriate, the crest elevations from the original Lake and Cook Counties Dataset were assigned to the shore protection structures (W.F. Baird & Associates Coastal Engineers Ltd. (2006): Benefit Analysis for the Illinois Shoreline Erosion Interim IV Lakebed Downcutting Reduction Project. Madison, Wisconsin). The Lake and Cook Counties study site on Lake Michigan is bound by the jetties at Gillson Park to the south and Waukegan Harbor to the north. The extent of shoreline is approximately 42 km, and is protected by both shore parallel and shore perpendicular structures.',\n",

You can also access the entire historical database to find out what other eBirders are reporting from across North America. In addition, the cumulative eBird database is used by birdwatchers, scientists, and conservationists who want to know more about the distributions and movement patterns of birds across the continent. Various regional eBird clones exist (aVerAves, Vermont eBird, Mass Audubon eBird, Texas eBird, Bird Conservation Network eBird, Gulf Coast Bird Observatory eBird), but they all contribute to the cumulative eBird database. +++++ This layer contains data that has been rolled up to each site and species combination, so that users may get a sense of the abundance of bird species across survey locations. +++++',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Light Pollution data set was created as part of a larger work, the Great Lakes Environment and Assessment Mapping (GLEAM) project. For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgLight pollution due to human activity is especially pronounced in near shore areas of high population density. Possible effects on aquatic organisms include disruption of fish foraging and reproductive behavior, and of vertical migration by zooplankton (a phenomenon in which zooplankton such as small crustaceans migrate to shallow waters by night to feed on algae and retreat to deeper waters during the day to avoid visually feeding fish). This data set shows a decline in light intensity with increasing distance from light sources and results in near-total light attenuation by about 45 km offshore.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The following dataset includes component and aggregated measures of environmental stress to coastal ecosystems from watersheds of the Great Lakes Basin. Stressors include the amount of agricultural and developed land use, as well as road and population density. These summaries are based on a set of 5971 watersheds that cover the US and Canadian Great Lakes basin, derived using methods from Hollenhorst et al. (2007). Indices presented in this dataset include SumRel (Host et al 2007) and the more recent combined Agriculture and Development - AgDev index (Host et al. In Prep).A brief description of the AgDev \\\\\"Euclidean Distance\\\\\" stressor integration, with R code, is here: https://github.com/NRRI/stressor_lib/tree/master/euc_distanceUse agdevbasn in preference to sumrel. For historical reference, for sumrel: we evaluated a number of normalizing transformations for each variable, including log, ln, and arcsine transformations. The use of high-resolution watersheds resulted in a large number of zeros (i.e. non-occurrence of the stressor) for many of the variables. The best results were obtained using a log10 transformation of non-zero values. Each of the five variables data values (x) were transformed to log10 (x), using the minimum non-zero value of x to replace zero values. These transformed (x\\') values were then standardized, (x\\'-m)/s, with m and s being the mean and standard-deviation for all x\\', respectively. These standardized values (x\\'\\') were then normalized, (x\\'\\'-min)/(max-min), with min and max being the minimum and maximum for all x\\'\\', respectively. Finally the five x\\'\\' values for each variable in each watershed were summed and the summed values normalized again to give a single number - SUMREL - for each watershed. SUMREL ranges from 0.0-1.0, with 1.0 representing the maximum composite stress within a geographic coverage of interest. Note that this design allows stressor scores to be calculated for any given spatial extent - from local watersheds to an ecoregion, lake, or basin.',\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgGreat Lakes beaches are areas of high recreational use, hosting an estimated 8 million annual visitors. Recreational beach use may act as a stressor due to refuse from millions of visitors, foot and vehicle traffic in sensitive dune areas, and through beach maintenance activities including beach grooming and infrastructure to reduce erosion. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

The shoreline was extracted from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 'Wateredg' data layer. Efforts were made to consistently and accurately capture the building outline but some challenges occurred including vegetation cover blocking building extent and shadows and image angle impacting building footprint identification.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Beach monitoring programs aim to decrease swimming-related illnesses resulting from exposure to harmful microbes in recreational waters, while providing maximum beach access. Managers are advised by the U.S. EPA to estimate microbiological water quality based on a 5-day geometric mean of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations or on a jurisdiction-specific single-sample maximum; however, most opt instead to apply a default single-sample maximum to ease application. We examined whether re-evaluation of the U.S. EPA ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) and the epidemiological studies on which they are based could increase public beach access without affecting presumed health risk. Single-sample maxima were calculated using historic monitoring data for 50 beaches along coastal Lake Michigan on various temporal and spatial groupings to assess flexibility in the application of the AWQC. No calculation on either scale was as low as the default maximum (235 CFU/100 mL) that managers typically use, indicating that current applications may be more conservative than the outlined AWQC. It was notable that beaches subject to point source FIB contamination had lower variation, highlighting the bias in the standards for these beaches. Until new water quality standards are promulgated, more site-specific application of the AWQC may benefit beach managers by allowing swimmers greater access to beaches. This issue will be an important consideration in addressing the forthcoming beach monitoring standards.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This layer represents *generalized* boundaries of Important Bird Areas (IBA) in Canada.  IBAs, in Canada and elsewhere, are evaluated and designated on the basis of internationally criteria.  The polygons contained in the dataset meet these criteria and are therefore deemed significant at the national, continental, or global level.  In Canada, IBAs are not legally recognized entities and therefore do not have any regulatory status.  Nevertheless, they are extremely useful for conservation planning for birds.  Polygon boundaries were digitized on-screen in ArcView GIS 3.2 by using NTDB 1:50K or 1:250K digital layers for reference.  If NTDB coverage was not available (e.g., far north), the Digital Chart of the World (1:1M) was used.  The boundaries of IBAs in this dataset are intentionally generalized to reflect the importance of the surrounding ecosystem on the values present within IBAs.  For example, small islands supporting colonies of seabirds might be buffered by 1 or 2 km to form an IBA.  Boundaries for a very small minority of IBAs were available in paper form as part of IBA conservation plans that had been developed previously.  In such cases, we visually estimated their boundaries against the NTDB or other base layers.  Many IBAs are already recognized as other types of protected areas, e.g., National Wildlife Areas, National and Provincial Parks, Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and so on.  In these cases, we used digital boundaries from other sources (e.g., WWF Canada's Designated Areas Database, Environment Canada's Canadian Conservation Areas Database) as reference points when digitizing IBA boundaries.

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgMarinas are a potential source of chemical pollution due to boat maintenance activities and spillage of a variety of compounds, and may exert physical effects on the environment associated with boat wakes, harbor dredging, breakwaters and shoreline structures. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgMercury is an important toxic substance affecting human and ecosystem health in the Great Lakes, and an example of a biomagnifying toxic metal. Human exposure to methylmercury in the Great Lakes basin is primarily through freshwater fish consumption.As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Research is focused on improving our ability to predict when algal blooms will occur, whether or not they are toxic, and their impact on human health. Field monitoring and observations collected by GLERL researchers keep track of nutrients at six master stations and two fixed moorings in western Lake Erie. The information gained from the field monitoring and observation assists in the development of probabilistic models for Lake Erie, which will be used to predict the magnitude of algal blooms while taking into account seasonal factors. GLERL and CIGLR's research and models support NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science in monitoring and forecasting these harmful blooms through the the Harmful Algal Bloom Bulletin.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This report summarizes the results of a two part survey administered to provide an assessment of the vulnerability of the upper Great Lakes marina industry to fluctuations in water levels of approximately one meter, both up and down, from the long term average water elevation during the boating season (May to October). Personal interviews with marina owners and operators as well as depth measurements at slips were completed at a total of seventeen areas of survey (AOS) spread along Lakes Erie, Huron and Superior; ten in Canada and seven in the United States of America. Based on the responses to questionnaires completed by 111 marina owner/operators (77 Canadian, and 34 U.S.A.), this report summarizes regional industry characteristics of the different sample areas, their experience with historical episodes of fluctuating water levels, as well as their responses to different scenarios of water level fluctuations pertaining to damages and adaptations. Physical depth measurements from 125 marinas (88 Canadian, and 37 U.S.A.) yielded regional slip-loss estimates for three incremental one foot (0.3m) drop scenarios below the 2009 average elevation during the boating season. Using the physical depth measurements, each marina’s set of slip measurements were subjected to three scenarios of one foot (0.3m) interval drops below the host Lake’s 2009 average elevation for the months during which surveys were completed.  The number of slips with less than two feet (0.6m) of water after a one foot (0.3m), two foot (0.6m) and three foot (0.9m) drop from this average were considered to be unusable.  Finally, this measure, as well as the costs reported in the operators’ responses, was used to generate rough economic loss estimates related to the three drop scenarios.',\n",

This station is South Entry to Keweenaw Waterway, 46.977896 N, 88.433310 W. Each thermistor chain includes six sensors spaced at 1-m intervals that collect water temperature data at depths of 1-6 m below the surface. The sensor chains were designed by Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) using Thermocron iButtons (model DS1921Z), temperature-sensitive resistors made of a semi-conductive material. Each iButton is enclosed in a 16 mm thick stainless steel can that is able to withstand the harsh conditions of Lake Superior. Following retrieval of the chains at the end of the season, temperature data are transferred from the iButton to a PC using a download wizard. Data are delivered to GLOS annually at the end of the buoy deployment season as a set of text files, one file per sensor. Each file consists of header data describing sampling parameters such as sample rate (60 minutes), temperature scale, mission start time, and total number of samples collected, followed by a data log of dates, times and temperatures. The design, deployment and monitoring of the Keweenaw Waterway thermistor chains is a collaboration between the Michigan Tech University Great Lakes Research Center, Michigan Tech Research Institute and Great Lakes Observing System.',\n",

       "  'title': 'GLERL Great Lakes Monthly Hydrologic Data (1860-2008)',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Accurate hydrologic data (over-lake precipitation, runoff, lake evaporation, net basin supplies, connecting channel flows, diversion flows, beginning-of-month lake levels, and changes in storage) are required for simulation, forecasting, and water resource studies on the Laurentian Great Lakes and their basins. These data are derived from meteorological and hydrological data. The 1993 reference is an update of the earlier report describing Great Lakes monthly hydrologic data. It was expanded and revised to include all available data through 1990 and to reflect improved computational techniques. The raw data utilized were collected from several sources, so the periods of record for each lake vary.While most of these data are available in the referenced reports, some of the data are not included in the report. These data may be available directly from GLERL. Daily values of some of these parameters may also be available from GLERL on a limited basis. These data were derived from quality controlled input data (see reference) and are periodically updated to reflect additional data and to extend the period of record. Note that missing data in the *.CIS files is denoted by -9999. This only occurs in December of the last year. Coverage includes Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and Lake St.Clair. Note: Most files have been updated through 1999. All data is now presented in spreadsheet format (MS-Excel 97 format). Some additional data types not present in the published report are also included in the data archive. Earlier versions of some of the spreadsheets (through 1995) are available as well (in the ArchivedFiles directory).',\n",

Research is focused on improving our ability to predict when algal blooms will occur, whether or not they are toxic, and their impact on human health. Field monitoring and observations collected by GLERL researchers keep track of nutrients at six master stations and two fixed moorings in western Lake Erie. The information gained from the field monitoring and observation assists in the development of probabilistic models for Lake Erie, which will be used to predict the magnitude of algal blooms while taking into account seasonal factors. GLERL and CIGLR's research and models support NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science in monitoring and forecasting these harmful blooms through the the Harmful Algal Bloom Bulletin.\",\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgCommercial fishing in the Great Lakes has experienced dramatic changes in target species and harvests due to the combined influences of over-fishing, invasive species and environmental deterioration. Lake Erie supports the largest and most heavily managed commercial fisheries, focused on yellow perch and walleye, and has seen recent recovery of its lake whitefish fishery. Current fisheries emphasize yellow perch and lake whitefish in Lake Ontario; lake whitefish, walleye and yellow perch in areas of Lakes Huron and Michigan; and cisco, lake trout and lake whitefish in Lake Superior. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Participants count birds for as little or as long as they wish during the four-day period and tally the highest number of birds of each species that they see at any one time. At the Great Backyard Bird Count web site, they fill out an online checklist to submit their counts. As the count progresses, anyone with Internet access can explore what is being reported from their own towns or anywhere in the United States and Canada. They can also see how the current year's numbers compare with those from any of the previous years. Participants may also send in photographs of the birds they see. A selection of images is posted in the GBBC online photo gallery. After the count, scientists analyze the results and post summaries highlighting the year's trends and findings. The Great Backyard Bird Count is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Audubon, with sponsorship from Wild Birds Unlimited. +++++ This layer contains the unique locations at which surveys have been conducted and should be used in conjunction with the appropriate summary and raw data layers to understand the distribution and abundance of birds in Canada. +++++\",\n",

For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgGreat Lakes ports and harbors are connected by a complex network of shipping lanes, locks and navigation channels that allow ships to travel over 3000 km from Duluth, MN, to the Atlantic Ocean. Environmental impacts associated with shipping lanes include shoreline erosion from wave action caused by passing ships, substrate disturbance due to propeller wash in shallow areas, habitat degradation from ice-breaking and winter navigation, and pollution from ship discharges. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

Field monitoring and observations collected by GLERL researchers keep track of nutrients at six master stations and two fixed moorings in western Lake Erie. The information gained from the field monitoring and observation assists in the development of probabilistic models for Lake Erie, which will be used to predict the magnitude of algal blooms while taking into account seasonal factors.

The SGB Dataset contains the entire shoreline delineated and classified to match Stewart’s classification scheme (Stewart C.J., 2002). Coldwater used high resolution aerial imagery, provided by Simcoe County, to identify and classify shore protection structures. A field survey of shore protection structures for Wasaga Beach, Collingwood, and Lafontaine was performed by Coldwater on 26 August 2010. Where appropriate, survey data, such as structure condition, composition, crest and toe elevations, and distance from the water’s edge, was added to the dataset. This survey provided the statistics of crest elevations for this study area. The Wasaga Beach study site is located on Georgian Bay of Lake Huron and includes the entire shoreline of Wasaga Beach and Collingwood. The Western boundary is defined by the municipal borders of Collingwood and The Blue Mountains, and the Eastern boundary is defined by the municipal borders of Wasaga Beach and Tiny. The total length of shoreline is approximately 44,800 m.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Developed Land data set was created as part of a larger work, the Great Lakes Environment and Assessment Mapping (GLEAM) project. For a full description of the GLEAM project, please see:-Allan, J.D., et al., 2013. Joint analysis of stressors and ecosystem services to enhance restoration effectiveness, PNAS 110(1)372-377.-http://www.greatlakesmapping.orgCoastal development disrupts physical and hydrodynamic processes and generates pollutants that, due to lake proximity, may introduce diverse contaminants into near shore waters. As part of the GLEAM project, we assembled data for 34 stressors likely to have adverse impacts on species, biological communities, or ecosystem dynamics across the entire surface of the Great Lakes, excluding connecting channels. Stressors were mapped at a square km resolution by interpolating or resampling as needed. We modeled the spatial footprint of stressors with influence beyond their point of origin using an exponential decay function with stressor-specific coefficients for stressors from tributary inputs and assumed that influence extended 1 km into the lake and transferred the shore-side stressor value to the adjacent lake-side pixel for shore-based stressors. To account for the differential vulnerability of various habitats to each threat, we developed a habitat classification and, using expert elicitation methods, we distilled survey responses from Great Lakes experts into quantitative weightings of the relative impact of each stressor on ecosystem condition for each lake and habitat type. The standardized value of each stressor's intensity was multiplied by its relative weight, pixel by pixel, and cumulative stress (CS) was computed additively as the sum of the weighted stressors. The resulting data set is an ESRI Grid, with a resolution of 1 square km. Source data were from multiple sources for the years 2000-2009, when possible.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Satellites such as Landsat 4, 5, and 7, Terra, EO-1 and others all share the same basic 705km, 98.9 minute near-polar sun synchronous orbit.  For the Landsat series, the ground trace of the orbit is described by the WRS-2 grid or index, (also known as WRS-II, World Reference System Two).  It consists of 233 unique orbit ground traces that are interlaced in 15 daily patterns of 16 orbits.  Therefore, every 16 days the ground traces repeat over the same locations (good for measuring change over time).  Data products from the Landsat series are produced from the strip of data received along a given path by cutting or dividing the data into rectangles or \\\\\"granules\\\\\" designated by row numbers for each path.  There are 248 rows to accompany each path.  This data layer represents the area coverage of WRS-2 polygons or Landsat \\\\\"footprints\\\\\" over the Great Lakes and connecting waterways. Each rectangle is approximately 185km wide and 175km long Note: Landsat 1-3 produced data tied to the WRS-1 system, which is similar but different.

       "  'abstract': 'Species occurrence data were obtained from the Atlas of Spawning and Nursery Areas of Great Lakes Fishes (Goodyear et al. 1982).     The atlas contains information on all of the commercially and recreationally important species that use the tributaries, littoral and open-water areas of the Great Lakes as spawning and nursery habitats.   Close to 9500 geo-referenced data records (occurrences of fish species) were imported into ArcView GIS.The 139 fish taxa reported in the Atlas had to be grouped into fewer broad categories to produce meaningful distribution maps.  We chose three functional classification schemes.  Jude and Pappas (1992) used Correspondence Analysis to partition fish species associated with the open water of each of the five Great Lakes and nine coastal wetlands.  Three species complexes were suggested:  a Great Lakes taxocene; a transitional taxocene, which utilized open water, near-shore, and wetlands; and a wetland taxocene.  We chose this as one of the classification schemes because we are particularly interested in identifying the distribution pattern of fish with coastal wetlands; for clarity sake, we have renamed these taxocenes coastal, intermediate and open-water, respectively.   For comparison, we also used Coker et al.’s (2001) classification based on temperature preferenda (5 classes) and Balon’s (1975) reproductive guild classification (32 guilds).',\n",
