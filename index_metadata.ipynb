       "     'title': 'Sediment Toxicity to Benthic Communities',\n",
       "     'abstract': \" Description of Work  At two of Wisconsin's Areas of Concern (AOCs) on Lake Michigan, the Sheboygan River AOC and Milwaukee Estuary AOC, the USGS will assess whether sediment toxicity from PCBs, PAHs, selected metals, ammonia, or dissolved oxygen is present at acutely toxic or chronically toxic concentrations using sediment toxicity tests conducted with amphipods and midges. Study planning and literature search have been completed. Sediment was collected in October 2016 from sites in the two AOCs and sites in two non-AOC comparison sites. Assesments will be done at two additional sites: Kewaunee River and Oak Creek. Laboratory toxicity tests and chemical analyses are in progress, including sediment toxicity testing and some chemical testing at the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center. Upon receipt and acceptance of all data in 2017, we will complete data analyses and complete a first draft of the interpretive report.  Goals &amp; Objectives  The goal of the study is to provide data on potential sediment toxicity to benthos and inform management decisions regarding possible removal of the “Degraded Benthos” beneficial use impairment (BUI) at the Sheboygan River AOC and the Milwaukee Estuary AOC. The objectives of the study are to: (1) Characterize sediment toxicity and relationships between toxicity and contaminant concentrations, and (2) Compare results to previous studies of sediment contamination, sediment toxicity, and benthic communities. This study addresses Focus Area 1—Toxic Substances and Areas of Concern, specifically the Areas of Concern portion of that focus area, in the Draft Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Action Plan II for FY15-19. It also fits into the USGS AOC Science Theme. This project has direct relevance to GLRI Objective 1 by providing data and interpretation toward Area of Concern Beneficial Use Impairments Removal, as an Action Plan Measure of Progress. A toxicity assessment of the river adjacent to the arsenic-contaminated area of the Kewaunee marsh will help the Wisconsin DNR to determine whether habitat remediation is needed in the river or whether efforts can focus on the marsh. An assessment of sediment toxicity in Oak Creek will provide the Wisconsin DNR with information to support efforts for aquatic habitat remediation in this important Milwaukee area watershed of Lake Michigan. The study addresses Focus Area 4–Habitat and Wildlife Protection and Restoration.  Products  Results for the AOCs (Sheboygan River and Milwaukee Estuary) and comparison non-AOCs (Manitowoc River and Root River) would be submitted as an interpretive report to a journal for publication. Upon review and acceptance, all data will be made publicly available on the web.\",\n",

       "     'abstract': ' If the invasive Asian carps (bighead carp&nbsp;<i>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</i>&nbsp;and silver carp&nbsp;<i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i>) migrate to the Great Lakes, in spite of the efforts to stop their advancement, these species will require the fast-flowing water of the Great Lakes tributaries for spawning and recruitment in order to establish a growing population. Two Lake Michigan tributaries (the Milwaukee and St. Joseph Rivers) and two Lake Erie tributaries (the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers) were investigated to determine if these tributaries possess the hydraulic and water-quality characteristics to allow successful spawning of Asian carps. To examine this issue, standard U.S.&nbsp;Geological Survey sampling protocols and instrumentation for discharge and water-quality measurements were used, together with differential global positioning system data for georeferencing. Non-standard data-processing techniques, combined with detailed laboratory analysis of Asian carp egg characteristics, allowed an assessment of the transport capabilities of each of these four tributaries. This assessment is based solely on analysis of observed data and did not utilize the collected data for detailed transport modeling.   All four tributaries exhibited potential settling zones for Asian carp eggs both within the estuaries and river mouths and within the lower 100 kilometers (km) of the river. Dams played a leading role in defining these settling zones, with the exception of dams on the Sandusky River. The impoundments created by many of the larger dams on these rivers acted to sufficiently decelerate the flows and allowed the shear velocity to drop below the settling velocity for Asian carp eggs, which would allow the eggs to fall out of suspension and settle on the bottom where it is thought the eggs would perish. While three rivers exhibited these settling zones upstream of the larger dams, not all settling zones are likely to have such effects on egg transport. The Milwaukee River exhibited only a short settling zone upstream of the Grafton Dam, whereas the St. Joseph and Maumee Rivers both had extensive settling zones (&gt;5 km) behind major dams. These longer settling zones are likely to capture more eggs than shorter settling reaches. All four rivers exhibited settling zones at their river mouths, with the Lake Erie tributaries having much larger settling zones extending more than 10 km up the tributaries.   While hydraulic data from all four rivers indicated settling of eggs is possible in some locations, all four rivers also exhibited sufficient temperatures, water-quality characteristics, turbulence, and transport times outside of settling zones for successful suspension and development of Asian carp eggs to the hatching stage before the threat of settlement. These observed data indicate that these four Great Lakes tributaries have sufficient hydraulic and water-quality characteristics to support successful spawning and recruitment of Asian carps. The data indicate that with the right temperature and flow conditions, river reaches as short as 25 km may allow Asian carp eggs sufficient time to develop to hatching. Additionally, examining the relation between critical shear velocity and mean velocity, egg settling appears to take place at mean velocities in the range of 15–25&nbsp;centimeters per second, a much lower value than is generally cited in the literature. A first-order estimate of the minimum transport velocity for Asian carp eggs in a river can be obtained by using mean flow depth and river substrate data, and curves were constructed to show this relation. These findings would expand the number of possible tributaries suitable for Asian carp spawning and contribute to the understanding of how hydraulic and water-quality information can be used to screen additional rivers in the future.
